It has a single USB cord with multiple tips for charging various items. You use the same cord to charge the battery, either off of your own USB charger or computer. It has two outputs to charge multiple items at once, and an emergency LED light.Four years ago we were caught in an ice storm, and while we didn't lose power, some of our friends spent nearly two weeks without power. We live in tornado country and are very sensitive to power outage issues, particularly now that our phone runs through a router. No power, no house phone. So our iPhone is our emergency lifeline.While I keep it charged under normal circumstances, putting it on the charger when I get home, Murphys law states that \"whatever can go wrong will go wrong.\" so I figure I will eventually hit a power outage with an undercharged battery on my iPhone. I have been looking for a solution, so that I know I will have power for the phone in an emergency. This very professional little charger is the perfect solution, and what seems to be a cute little LED light just adds to the idea of using this during a power outage.It does charge up my iPad (a different kind of emergency), but I suspect theIncredicharge I-11000 External Battery Pack and Charger 11000mAh Capacity for iPad2, iPad 3, HP Touchpad iPhone 4 4s 3Gs 3G (AT&T; and Verizon), iPod Touch (1G 2G 3G 4G 5G), HTC Android EVO, Blackberry, Samsung Galaxy S, Droid, Nintendo, Sony PSP and Man...will do a better job. Still, emergencies are emergencies.I am keeping my battery in my office (and making sure it remains charged), so that it will always be handy. Just the feeling of security knowing it is there is well worth the price!While I have a car charger for trips in the car, I have made long Amtrak trips where it would have very helpful to keep my iPhone and iPad charged, when few outlets were available. The same holds true for camping trips, so far we haven't managed to find a tent with an outlet pre-installed. Just remember on a longer trip, you will also have to recharge the charger.I was very grateful to have been offered the opportunity to receive a complimentary charger to consider for a review right at the beginning of our season of bad weather.

We have only a single cigarette charger adapter in our car, and typically we end up using that for charging someones cell phone while we are on-the-go. This batter charger is perfect for adding hours and hours of game time to the kids devices, and they can even keep playing with this battery pack plugged into the device and charging it.Do a lot of traveling and have an iPod Touch/iPhone? The I-5000 is perfect for you. Our 4 Gen iPod touch is constantly being charged with this and it's like they were made for each other. My daughter's iPod never leave her hand, and even with their ample battery life, hers is always about to die right as we're getting in the car to go somewhere. Thankfully now we always keep this close by, as it has literally become the iPod charger for when we are out. She is able to play apps and listen to her music for hours longer because of keeping this Increditcharge I-5000 on hand.To charge this battery up, just plug in the included USB cable into your computer and it will start charging on its own. In addition to the variety of tip attachments that comes with it, it also has 2 USB ports on the side, so if you have a device like a small digital camcorder/camera that charges via USB (like my Kodak PlayFull HD Video Camera does), you can even charge it by plugging it into this external battery.With a compact design, an auto shut off feature when your devices are fully charged, a built in push-button LED light feature (wonderful when traveling in the car at night) and a whole host of electronics that can be charged by this (far more than just the few listed here), this charger is the perfect addition to traveling with your devices so you can enjoy them for many more hours.

In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have not been impressed with a single one of them. Hence I was a bit skeptical when trying this new battery, but my skepticism proved to be unwarranted.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that, with the unsurprising exception of the iPad, I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S,iPhone 3G,Motorola KRZR,Motorola RAZR,Kindle Keyboard,Mobee Magic Bar,Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the aforementionediPad (First Generation) (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge two or three devices with just one Incredi Cahrge fully charged battery. I was also able to charge two devices simultaneously. I was only able to charge my iPad to 55% of its full charge, but considering iPad's size this is still really impressive.To fully charge this battery it takes about six hours. This is much longer than some other such batteries that I have tested, and I think this is primarily due to the fact that it relies on USB connection for powering. The best way to charge this battery is to leave it plugged in overnight. You can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone USB charger.Incredi Charge battery is fairly well designed and very compact. It's about twice as thick as iPhone 4/4S, and about half an inch shorter. It's also fairly light, and overall very convenient and portable.Even though I am generally very impressed and pleased with this charger, there are a couple of issues that I have. The seven different charging connectors are very small and they don't connect too securely to the USB cable. Being so small may make them prone to getting lost. I think that equipping the charger with its own \"drawer\" where the connectors would be kept would be useful, although that would certainly add to the bulk of the battery itself and make it less portable. I've discovered that using your own dedicated USB charging cord (if available) is usually preferable to fiddling with the attachments.The bigger issue is that by relying on USB ports for charging you lose the convenience being able to charge it by just plugging in into the wall power outlet. With the ubiquity of USB devices and stand-alone USB power supplies, this is much less of an issue than it would have been just a few years ago. I am perfectly happy with this method of charging, but if you anticipate having to primarily rely on power outlets in your personal or professional life, then you might want to reconsider getting this battery.Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with this battery supply. It is effective, portable, and very affordable. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot or uses their gadgets on the go all the time.***** Review product provided by the distributor. *****", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worthy of its name", "unixReviewTime": 1330041600, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2012"}

It's about the size of an empty wallet, which makes it completely portable.So far, I've found that if I really want to fully charge my Kindle Fire with the Incredicharge, it takes hours and completely drains the Incredicharge. I can use the Fire as it's charging, but I don't if I want to get the full charge and get it more quickly.The Kindle 3G charges faster than the Fire. We went camping last night. I plugged in the Kindle 3G, tended a fire for a short while, got ready for bed and before I knew it, it went from fully discharged to half charged. I'd say that all took about an hour and my Incredicharge still has 3/4 charge left.

It can also be plugged into the USB wall plugs. It just can't be plugged into an outlet directly. For some, this may be an inconvenience.My only disappointment is no connector is included for the Nintendo DS Lite or 3DS. We need to supply our own DS Lite or 3DS USB cords.

You could also use a 2-Port USB Car Charger Adapter to refill the Incredicharge in your car.  This comes in handy when you're traveling without a computer. (Thanks to smartphones!)

It was a lifesaver when I was at a trade show for a long day of emailing, looking things up and making calls on the iPhone and almost running out of power. I had this unit with a full charge on it in my briefcase and charged the phone right back up again.  And the nice thing is that it's so small and unobtrusive that I just set in inside my not-too-large briefcase while it charged and didn't have to make a big production of finding space to go through the recharging process.The first time I tried it, I had what looked like about half a charge on my iPhone and my Kindle was showing the \"low battery\" warning.

The provided connectors are mini USB, micro USB, PSP, Apple iPod/iPhone, Sony Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung.The I-5000 has two USB output jacks, so it can power two devices simultaneously.  To power or charge a device, you connect it to the I-5000 using an appropriate USB cord, and then turn the unit on.  Power should flow to the device, and charging should begin.  The typical indication of charging (moving arrows, moving bars, battery symbol, etc.) should be indicated on your device.  While the device is being charged, in most cases it can also be used.  You will have to monitor when your device is fully charged, and then disconnect and turn off the I-5000.Although the I-5000 can power two devices at a time, its performance will vary according to the power draw of the devices, so you may not be able to immediately use everything that you plug in.  The lithium ion battery has a capacity of 5000mAh, and an output of 5 volts.  In addition the I-5000 has a small LED light that serves as a mini-flashlight.The palm sized Incredi-Charge has rounded edges, and is easy to grip, although its shiny front cover is something of a fingerprint magnet, and is very easily scratched.  It seems to be pretty well built nicely designed, and not too heavy.  It would be nice if it came with some kind of carrying pouch, for protection, or some means to help keep the cord and connector from getting separated or lost.While easy and convenient to use as kind of a universal power supply, the I-5000 is generally not something that you will use every day, but could be nice to have around as insurance.  It might be quite useful when travelling, or if you unexpectedly find that your battery is dead.  It has a limited one year warranty, which is not bad for an electronic device, and would probably be a decent value buy at about the $20 dollar level.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "convenient, relatively useful source of backup power...", "unixReviewTime": 1332460800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2012"}

I hope that my product evaluation is objective but I should note that PowerGen provided me a free unit for review. I did not promise a good review in exchange and PowerGen did not ask for one.The 2 provided modular charging cords have a USB-A port at one end while the other end accepts any of the 6 supplied adapters: USB-B, USB-Mini, USB-Micro, Apple and two round adapters of which one I could successfully use to charge a PSP and the other fit (but did not charge) our XOOM tablet. The charger fills itself up through any AC outlet via the included AC adapter through one of the supplied modular charging cords. Output is from 2 USB-A ports through the modular cables and adapters. And the Juice Pack is not only a charger but it also comes with a one-LED light, just in case.It's true that the Pack doesn't charge 'everything' but I was able to use it with lots of devices around the house: a Blackberry Torch, a Kindle Fire, three Kindle reader models, a Sansa Clip, a Playstation Portable, a Nexus 7, an iPhone 4s. Didn't charge our XOOM tablet but that was expected because XOOM was not on the 'compatibles' list.As far as I can tell, the Amazon specs section is accurate and so are the compatibility claims at least for the devices I was able to test. On a full charge and it does take 6-8 hours to fully charge the Pack, it consumed about half of its juice to fully charge a Blackberry Torch. Whatever was left was enough to fill up a Kindle 3, a PSP, a Sansa Clip MP3 player and a Kindle Touch about one third of the way.As much as I like the Juice Pack, the product loses one star because it comes without a storage case for the 9 small accessories and there is no protective carrying case for the charger itself - there should be one for a product that's meant to travel. The odds are that some of the many accessories are going to be misplaced or lost unless the buyers provide their own storage case or box.

Manual says the slower 0.6 amp port can achieve 4 iPhone charges.Charging speed averaged 1.0% per minute from the 2A port -- same as an Apple wall charger. Charging speed does not diminish as the PowerGen runs down. (At times it achieved 1.11% per minute, even with bits of screen use during the test. My testing stopped at 90%. iPhone charges slower from 80% to 100% with all chargers).PowerGen did not seem to heat up, ever.Note 3: 7-piece interconnect system includes Apple, USB-mini, USB-micro, 2mm round (Nokia), and 4mm round (PlayStation Portable).

I also own a Kindle Fire and my wife has an iPad.  Both her iPad and my Kindle require the larger output chargers (2.1A).  This charger works for both of us.  I've used a LOT of different mobile chargers this year, and this one is definitely one of my two favorites.Here's what I love best about this charger (and I think all Kindle Fire owners should agree):  It has one input port that I haven't seen on any other portable chargers--a micro USB.Why is that important?  No need for proprietary cables.I hate proprietary cables.  I don't want to have to carry around a bunch of tips and fittings to make all my stuff work.  It's bad enough that Apple products require their own cables, but I really don't want to have to bring yet another cable along to charge my charger.  That's why this one is awesome for me and my Kindle Fire (same goes for any other devices that use the micro USB connection).  I already carry myAmazonBasics USB Cable - 2.0 A Male to Micro B (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters)wherever I go.  They're cheap enough that I keep one at home, at my office, in my truck, and in my briefcase.  So now, wherever I can plug in my Kindle Fire, I can also plug in this mobile charger.This thing is great.  With 8400mAh (milliampere-hours), it has a lot of power for multiple charges.  I can charge my iPhone and my Kindle Fire both more than once from this charger.  This is ideal for travel or even for commuting with public transportation, because there are plenty of times when I need a charge and I can't get to an outlet.  It's especially great for long flights, because I can easily burn through the charge on my iPhone or Fire if I'm watching videos or playing games.  But I actually use this the most sitting right on my couch in the evening.  At the end of the day, my devices are out of charge just like I am.  It's great to be able to plug them into this little charger and be able to charge them and use them at the same time while I watch TV--without having to use a stupid extension cord.I should point out that although you can use a micro USB cable to charge this, it also comes with its own proprietary charger (which went straight into the drawer in my case).  It also has a huge set of tips for just about any device you can think of.  So don't feel left out if you don't have the same love affair with the micro USB connection as I do.I mentioned that I've used a bunch of different chargers this year and that this one is one of my favorites (or probably my new favorite).  What do I love about it so much (besides the micro USB connection)?  Well...* It's very compact.  This charger is smaller than some of the smaller 5000mAh chargers I own (and those things only give 1A output, so no joy for my Kindle or iPad).  It's definitely smaller than any high-output charger that I own.  Its footprint is roughly the same width of my iPhone (with its case on) and about an inch less in length.  It's probably about twice as thick as an iPhone 4 without a case.* It has one of the cleaner designs I've seen.  This family of chargers is relatively new, and a lot of them look like they were designed very quickly and without much attention to quality or appearance.  This one looks really nice though.  The case is very high-gloss plastic, which makes it easy to wipe off and keep clean from smudges and dust.* The charge level indicators are very bright and visible.  Some of my other chargers are difficult to tell how charged they are (you have to push a button to read the level).  And some of them don't give any indication of charge level at all.  This one has four blue glowing circles.  When it's charging, the blue lights pulse to indicate that it is charging and the lights stay on steady to show the charge state (one steady light means 25%, two means 50%, three means 75% and four means it's done).  This is nice for taking the guesswork out of it.  These lights also give you a quick indicator whether it's turned on or not.  The power button is recessed and a little tough to activate, so these lights let you know right away whether it's on.* This also includes a small white LED flashlight.  That's a nice feature for some, but I really don't have a use for it.I've used other PowerGen products in the past, so I'm confident in the product's reputation and quality and I believe that the company stands behind their products.8400mAh is a lot of charging time to carry around.  If it's just for one person, it will keep you charged up for a couple of days.  Or if it's for a family on a trip, you can pass it around and charge everyone up (or even charge two devices at once).  I highly recommend this charger.I was provided this charger for review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic for the Kindle Fire", "unixReviewTime": 1344038400, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2012"}

Chambers", "helpful": [27, 34], "reviewText": "The PowerGen Duo-Power External Battery Pack is a nifty little device to have in your purse, pocket, or backpack for those inevitable times when a cellphone, small tablet, or ebook reader dies for lack of battery power. It's small (about 3.75\" x 2.4\" x 0.7\") and fairly lightweight (7 ounces), and with 8400 mAh of reserve power (the equivalent of about 3-4 rechargeable 1.2V NiMH AA batteries), it should recharge just about any small mobile device.When I received the battery pack, three of the four charge indicator lights were on, signifying a 50-75% charge. I plugged it into an electrical outlet, and about two hours later, it was fully charged. The product description indicates that a full charge can be restored to a drained battery pack in 9-10 hours with the included 5.3V/1A AC adapter. I also tried recharging the battery pack with a PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Charger. I didn't time the recharging with the PowerGen AC adapter, but with 10 watts of power, it should reduce the charging time by as much as 50%.I've tested the battery pack with several mobile devices that we have, including a Kindle Fire, Kindle 3 (aka Kindle Keyboard), iPhone 4, and a Samsung Stratosphere cellphone, and it worked as advertised to extend the battery life. I did not attempt to quantify exactly how much extension of battery life it provided, but with 8400 mAh of power, it should be significant, even with the higher power consumption of devices like the Kindle Fire.The battery pack kit contained two cables (identical except for the length) and five different plug types, including an Apple plug, a micro USB plug, and two others that I didn't recognize (there were two of the micro USB plugs). As far as I know, you could recharge two devices simultaneously, since the battery pack has two ports.A nice extra feature of the battery pack is a built-in LED flashlight. The power button is flush with the case and requires two presses, so there's little chance of accidentally turning it on and depleting the battery.One minor complaint: The battery pack has two output ports - one for 5.3V/2000mA and one for 5.3V/600mA. The port next to the flashlight is labeled 0.6A and the other port is labeled 2A, but the labels are very hard to read. (It's much easier to read if you look on the side of the case, where the labels are easier to read below their respective ports.)Just a reminder: Any rechargeable battery loses some of its charge every day, so if you keep this or any other battery pack in your purse or backpack or briefcase, you need to take it out occasionally and recharge it.The bottom line: A very handy, indispensable little gadget for anyone on the go whose cellphone or other small electronic devices run out of battery power and an AC or vehicle charger is not available.Note: The seller offered to send me a PowerGen Duo-Power External Battery Pack 8400mAh to test and review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An indispensable device for people on the go with mobile devices", "unixReviewTime": 1333152000, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2012"}

Even if you have access to the wall/AC jack, sometime you don't feel like carrying those AC adapters. Generally speaking, I think most people can use some extra juice on their devices. And this battery pack works well to provide additional power well and compatible with most devices. This product also has a decent built-in LED flashlight (double click the power button to operate the LED flashlight).I was curious on why the two ports have two different amperage rating and after a bit of research, here's what I think the reason is:Q: Can I blow up my device if I plug it to the wrong port (e.g. take a phone with 500mA requirement/wall charger and we plug it into the 2000mA)?A: No. You can plug any USB device into any USB cable and into any USB port, and nothing will blow up -- and in fact, using a more powerful charger should speed up battery charging.Q: So if you can't blew your device, why not make both USB port 2000mA (vs 2000mA and 600mA)?A: Some older devices (mainly pre-2007) will not take high-amperage USB (e.g. 2000mA), so you might need to use the lower amperage option to make the charging work (though as mentioned above plugging it into the 2000mA won't blow up the device)This PowerGen battery pack is compatible with most devices but it doesn't hurt to check the compatibility list before you buy.Compatible with:- Apple iPhone 4s,4,3Gs,3G,2G/iPod Touch/iPad/iPad 2/iPod Nano,shuffle,classic- Amazon Kindle Fire, and all other kindles- Blackberry Curve/Storm 9530/Storm 2 9550 9520/Tour 9630 Style 9670 Bold 9650 9700 9780/Torch 9800- Google Nexus One/Nexus S- HTC Sensation XE XL/Thunderbolt/Flyer/EVO 3D- LG Optimus,2x,V,S,T/Quantum/Vortex- Motorola Atrix/Bionic/Droid Razr,X,X2,2,3,Pro,R2D2/Xoom/Triumph- Nokia N900/N8/N97/C6/C3- Samsung Galaxy S 2/Epic 4G/ Galaxy Nexus- Sony Experia /X1/X10/X8/Arc/Neo/Play/MiniNot Compatible with:- Galaxy Tab series- Asus TransformerHere's what you would expect to get when using this battery pack.You can opt for higher/lower mAh battery rating if you want more/less juice.- 80% of iPad 2 Battery life- 400% of 4G 4S 3G 3Gs iPhone Battery life- 40% of iPad 3 Battery life- 150% of Kindle Fire Battery life- 10 hours iPad 2 movie playing time- 40 hours iPhone internet time- 70 hours iPhone audio timeOverall, this PowerGen Duo-Power External Battery Pack 8400mAh is a very solid product.

Rather than repeat all of the features that I described that both units have in common, let me focus on what makes this product different.1. This is larger and measures 3 3/4\" x 2 3/8\" x 3/4\". However, this is not bulky and more than compact enough to bring when you travel.2. This has two output ports: .6A and 2A. The 2A is great for charging an iPad. I charged an iPad from 80% to 100% in the same time it takes when plugged into an AC outlet, and I barely made a dent in this unit's power supply.3. The 5200 has a large power button on the top that makes it easy to operate the flashlight. This unit has a much smaller power button located to the right of the micro USB, but it's still pretty easy to use.Bottom line: This is a good unit for regular charging of an iPad, and also where you need a longer power supply than what is provided by the 5200.

Another half-inch would have made these perfect styluses for me. Anyone with small hands and children should find near-perfect.Here are the reasons to like/love them:- Come in a bunch. It's natural to lose one or two styluses every couple of month so a set of nine should last quite a while.- Shirt pocket clip.- Nice colors.- Nicely packaged and easy to store with an individual 'pocket' in the common 9-styluses wrapper.- Durable, or so they appear after a few days of use.If 4-inchers aren't too short for you, get these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Colors of Sty-HD", "unixReviewTime": 1376524800, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2013"}

While you don't have to apply a whole lot of pressure, just a light touch of the stylus may not work, so keep this in mind. Also, keeping the stylus perpendicular to the plane of the device works better in many cases (though not usually necessary). If these are issues for you, then you may not like using a stylus.My review for this 9 piece pack is as follows.This set is indeed very nice and colorful. However, the colorful finish can be scratched easily with sharp objects.Using a stylus helps keep fingerprints off your device, which is a nice benefit.These styli do have a plastic clip, however.

If you do not apply enough pressure, it will be unresponsive on some devices, with some devices requiring more pressure than others. While you don't have to apply a whole lot of pressure, just a light touch of the stylus may not work, so keep this in mind. Also, keeping the stylus perpendicular to the plane of the device works better in many cases (though not usually necessary). If these are issues for you, then you may not like using a stylus.My review for this 17 piece pack is as follows.This set is indeed very nice and colorful. However, the colorful finish can be scratched easily with sharp objects. I did receive a colorful set unlike some of the reviews that complain about not receiving all the colors.Using a stylus helps keep fingerprints off your device, which is a nice benefit.These styli do have a plastic clip, however. It would be nicer if they were metal but I can't complain much given the price.The small ones can attach to the headphone jack on an iPod or tablet device, or anything with a headphone jack. It can easily be removed and reattached. This is a nice little 'trick'... but be careful not to lose the stylus because it's not strongly attached via the headphone jack. It can be removed as easily as (or maybe a little easier) than a real set of headphones.Overall 4 stars because they are not as responsive as a real finger, but it does work well enough with a moderate amount of pressure applied.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice set of colorful styli, but some quirks", "unixReviewTime": 1394323200, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2014"}

This set, theSty-HD 2 Pack of Premium Precision Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip, and theBusiness Stylus Executive Pen.  Of the three, the multipack set is the most generic.  Made almost completely in plastic with some plating to look like metal, this type of stylus, perhaps the exact same stylus, can be bought from a wide selection of vendors at different prices.  In use, they work pretty ok, but not perfectly.  The glide is a little off, especially with matte screen protectors.  During testing, I noted that these tend to not work as well with Apple devices compared to Android models.  Pressing slightly harder on the Apple screens would get better functionality, but rapid movement across the screen didn't work consistently.  Overall, tolerable performance for the cheap price, hence the three stars which matches Amazon's \"It's OK\" meaning.  Compared to its brethren, they work as well as the Business stylus, but lack the pen.  Speaking of the Business model, though asking a premium price, its performance isn't any better than the one from the multipack as they share the same type of tip.  It looks more business like, true, but even the pen doesn't work great.  After cleaning the tip of the pen to clear off the seal to prevent ink leaking out while in shipping, I found the writing to be uneven and scratchy.  I could literally hear the ball in the tip scratching at the the paper.  To me, not worth the current price of nine bucks.  That leaves the the model with the hybrid fiber tip.  Of all three, these performed the best across the board.  Much better glide and screen response.  Still not perfect, as rapid movement would miss on occasion, but certainly a cut above the others.  Again, the Apple devices didn't these as much as Android devices did, and matte screen protectors deteriorated the performance slightly.  Comparing all three to the stylus that comes with my Tegra Note, the Tegra's stylus is the easy winner in all subjective and objective testing.  This is not a surprise really, as the stylus and screen of the Tegra Note were designed specifically to work together.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Sty is the limit", "unixReviewTime": 1394928000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2014"}

The rubber stylus end is hollow, so you have to exert a bit extra effort to get a response.  For some reason, I don't quite like seeing how the rubber squishes flat on my screen...but that's my idiosyncrasy. I found that--with the hollow rubber--the stylus end sometimes dimpled.

The full-size stylus is still a bit too short for me to use in a pen-like fashion for an extended writing/note taking session.Having said that, I do like how they include three different styles in the pack.

They sent it anyway.  Gutsy move.  I thought, here's a company that believes in its product.  So, I've been using it on my daily walks.I was a little self-conscious, at first, but now I don't feel as ridiculous as I imagined.  The phone attaches via the charging port, but it's secure.  I haven't had any accidental releases that I imagined would happen.  In fact, sometimes I forget it's not a charging cord and just try to yank it out.  It doesn't come off unless I simultaneously squeeze the release buttons on the side.The attached ear buds are metal, which means I can wipe them off with alcohol.  They don't slip out, but I get a better fit with other types of ear buds.  These don't block ambient noise, if I keep the volume down.  I like that, since I'm walking and I want to hear the car coming before it hits me.The ear buds connect via auxiliary port, so I don't have to bother with Bluetooth.  I get crisp and clear music in stereo with my iPhone 4S.  It lacks a little in warmth but it's not bad at all.  The average listener would not find have any issues with it.Although I'm still not a fan of wearing my phone on a lanyard, I like the iHangy more than I thought I would.  It allows me quick access to the phone and a great thing to have when I don't have pockets.  I wouldn't recommend it for the gym or jogging, since the phone swings around and is likely to be bumped or get in the way.  It's best used for walking.If you want to wear your phone, this works quite well.  The mount is secure and the sound quality good.

The connector has two little spring hooks that stick out and secure the phone. These are VERY thin and look like they could break over time.

Generally you get what you pay for, but in the case of the iHangy, you get a great bang for the buck.The bass is punchy enough, treble good enough, that I don't need any EQ to be done on the sound at all to get a sound I like. Like all headphones though, unless you go to find a pair specifically built for neutral sound, there will be some &#34;color&#34; added. In this case, the added color over neutral, for me, is what these phones need.In terms of the utility of them, well, they make the assumption you will trust the plastic charger insert will hold your iPhone 3-4s safely when you are performing activities. Reality is, it does a great job and hasn't fallen out yet. It clamps tightly into the charger port and I don't feel as though it will fall out. I've put as much force as I am willing on the connection, and it had no issues holding the force of my pulling and keeping the phone connected. Good stuff.My only issue is that the cable included to plug into the headphone jack isn't long enough to just put your phone in your pocket and carry. Yes, that would defeat the concept, but having the option, as these headphones sound great for the price, would be a nice addition for the next model.If you're on the market for a pair of earbud headphones, and want the utility of carrying your phone around your neck, and want good sound quality for the price, the iHangy is a great addition to your music listening and iPhone carrying arsenalHighly recommended..", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surprisingly good sound", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2014"}

My iPhone 5 quickly recognized the unit and paired it without inputting any information or pressing buttons.  One bit of advice however, make sure to turn off ANY other Bluetooth devices you may have on in your vehicle.  It will cause conflict issues if you have more than one Bluetooth device on at the same time and they may not work properly when you try to use them again.The LED lights are easy to read and use.

Unfortunately there's no auxiliary port in the truck for plugging in an MP3 player via a 3.5mm cable to play music from.

Once the transmitter has been set up and paired with your phone, it's simple to run for even those who don't particularly find electronics easy to work with (like my husband). We plugged it into the cigarette lighter and set it up with my iPhone 4s. Turning the tuner to an FM station that's not in use lets you play your music or any other audio broadcasting from your your device right to the vehicles speakers.While testing it out, I found that the dock held my phone securely and I could adjust the arm around to set the transmitter and my phone at just the right angle and height to be accessed while driving. The phone dock/holder can be adjusted to fit all kinds of cell phones and devices. And on the bottom of the dock, they've even included a USB port, so you can charge your phone or any other device that uses the USB adapter.I prefer using this over a 3.5mm cable since the transmitter also gives your phone a docking station to be mounted on, instead of it just hanging down on the console or needing to install a permanent dash mount for the phone.

There are no radio stations in my area that play the kind of music I like best, and I wasn't willing to spend the money on satellite radio, so I've just been listening to \"kind of okay\" music in the car for years. At home, I love listening to Pandora.When I was offered the opportunity to review this, I jumped at it. After some initial confusion because the instructions aren't entirely clear, I was able to get the device tightened into my cigarette lighter, paired, and to an empty channel. (One oddity is that it kept going to stations that end in even numbers, when my car stereo will only do odd numbers.) Some stations had more background static than others, so I kept trying until I reached one that had very little.The volume is a bit low even when it's at its highest level, and can cause quite a scare when you take the unit out if you forget to turn down the volume first-- the regular radio volume is WAY higher than this transmits, so I about jumped out of my skin twice when I pulled out the unit and then heard Pink seemingly screaming into my ears.The sound quality is not as good as what you'll normally hear on the radio, but it's still good enough for me! It was such a pleasure to get to listen to \"my own\" music all day today while driving around.A couple of drawbacks: I baaaarely got the iPhone to fit in the mount with its Otterbox case on. But it really doesn't matter-- you don't need to mount the phone there to use it. I just stuck my phone into the cup holder and left the mount empty.

I used the default setting at 87.9.From there, the options are great:Answer your calls hands free -- It automatically chimes when you get a call. Answer the call and your caller is heard through the speakers in your car. I was told that, although they knew they were on speaker phone, I was clear and easy to hear.

The music sounded great (as great as my car speakers were capable of producing) and I had a clear, no interference stream of music. You can forward or repeat using your phone but the Incredisonic also has advance and reverse buttons for moving ahead or backwards in your track order.Listen to your iPod -- (or any mp3 device).

You cannot use the track advance with your iPod though.Use it as a car mount -- This is probably the one area that I wasn't as thrilled with.

I've tried several FM transmitters over the years and none of them really worked well.  The music was always full of static or was so weak that driving a block or two or turning a corner lost the signal.  So I wasn't too optimistic when I tried this Incredisonic Bluetooth FM Transmitter, but guess what?  The thing works.  And it works perfectly.  The sound quality is excellent. All you have to do is plug this device into your car cigarette lighter and pair it with your phone. (I have an iPhone 4S.) It found the phone right away and I was listening to my music in just a couple of minutes.  I love devices that work so easily. And you only have to pair it the first time.  After that, whenever the transmitter is on it automatically pairs.  The phone is held securely and you don't have to worry about it coming out of the cradle until you take it out.  I like that it keeps it handy and in view and I don't have to fumble around to find my phone when it rings or when I need it.  It has a flexible gooseneck arm that lets you adjust the position.There are some other nice things that this transmitter does.  It works with my iPhone as a speakerphone so I hear the person I'm talking to over the radio.  The sound is just as clear and static free as the music. It also would work great as a GPS (if the iPhone operating system gets its maps working correctly.)  Since the phone attaches with a USB cord, it charges my phone while I'm listening to it. This is a great feature on long trips.  My phone always stays charged. I stream Pandora and use Siri to dial numbers, and get me information or send a quick email.  If you don't want to put your phone in the holder you can still plug it into the USB port on the holder and put your phone wherever you like and all the features still work.

When I find one I like -- and I do have a few brands that I do -- I make sure to hang onto them.  This Toddy Gear cloth is one of the good guys.Because the \"smart cloth\" is made with two fabrics, one on each side, the cloth is thicker than most, making it easier to handle.

It weight 4.7 oz. It comes with a 6 inch charging cable and 4 connectors: Mini USB, Micro USB, PSP, iPhone.The battery pack should be fully charged before the first use. It took overnight for it to reach full charge.  The manufacturer states that the battery life is over 500 cycles.Photo #1 shows how each adapter connects to the USB cable. The adapters are a weak point of the design, they feel a bit flimsy and it is easy to loose all the small pieces.A button on top of the unit turns the unit on and off (hold it for a few second to turn off). Note that the unit does not shut off when not in use.  It wil continue to drain power unless you turn it off manually.There 4 blue lights on top of the unit. A single light on one side of the button indicates on/off status.  The three lights on the other side of the button indicate the charings status (3 lights full, 2 light 30 to 80% full, 3 lights charge is 80% or more. The power pack also has an LED light, which can be used a flashlight.The 5200mAh Yubi Power has one USB outlet. I tested my four electronic devices using both my own USB cable as well as the manufacture cable+adapter. I wanted to see the difference between the cables, and the difference was significant.The provided adapters fit Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone, Nexus 7 tablet and Sansa Clip MP3 (as they take regular USB-to-micro USB cable) but none of the provided adapters fit Galaxy Samsung 7.7 Tablet (so for Galaxy I could only test with my own USB cable).I used Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.The key findings:================(1) The power pack worked well with Nexus devices,but did not work at all with Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet.(2) Using Yubi Power charging cables vs generic cables made a significant differenceDifference between a power cable and a data cable:Charging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see them as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source. Both my generic cable and Yubi Power cables used in my tests are charging cables.Description of my tests:I tested each devices charging them for 10 minutes using Yubi Power cable and using my own charging cable.The table below summarizes my findings.Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone (photo #1)-----------------------------------generic cable ...... USB source ... 1% charge in 10 minutesYubi Power cable ... AC source .... 6% charge in 10 minutesNexus 7 Tablet (photo #2)-----------------------------------generic cable ...... AC source .... 0% charge in 10 minutes (barely charging, enough to power the screen and not lose charge)Yubi Power cable ... AC source .... 4% charge in 10 minutesSamsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7 (photo #3)-----------------------------------generic cable .... dischargingYubi Power cable -- no adapter, cannot be usedSanDisk Sansa Clip+ MP3 Player-----------------------------------generic cable ........ worksYubi Power cable ..... worksThe MP3 player recognized the charger on both outlet, however it behaved differently than charging from the charger it came with.When I charge Sansa MP3 with a standard AC charger, the MP3 player goes into charging mode, displaying the charging animated icon. When it was plugged into the Yubi Power external battery it continued to play the content. I listen to books on my MP3 player so this caused me to move forward in my book and I had to manually reset my position by a few chapters to get back to where I was when I started charging. The positive side of this, is that is possible to continue listening while MP3 is recharging. This is very handy for Sansa MP3 player since it has built-in battery that cannot be swapped for a charged one.To summarize:I liked:-----------------------------------1. Good behavior with Nexus devices.2. Solution for MP3 player with built-in batteryI did not like:-----------------------------------1. Does not work for Galaxy Tablet 7.7 (with my own adapter, no Yubi Power adapter)2. The multiple piece connectors are flimsy and easy to loose.

I would like to thank Yubi Power for sending me a copy of this battery charger to review.There are several reviews up already that do a fantastic job of documenting the performance of this charger, and I highly recommend giving them a read. Not that I don't have my own thoughts to add, but I tend to look at the design and functionality of a product, rather than its performance. The YP520A is a highly portable device - it can easily be slipped into a pocket or laptop bag without taking up too much space or adding too much weight - this, more than any other feature, is the reason why this battery charger goes with me almost everywhere! There are a few design-related things that I wanted to talk about. The first is the really subtle LED system that lets you know that the device is on, charging, and what sort of charge is left. On many of the battery packs I have tried, the LEDs were WAY too bright (a pet peeve of mine), meaning that when being used on a night-stand they had to be turned over so as not to light up the room. Not so with the YP520A - the blue LEDs are subtle yet informative. This battery pack also has a single-LED flashlight built in - a welcome feature that I have actually used many times. The documentation states that the flashlight will run for 250hrs, so I assume the drain on the battery will be negligible for occasional usage.Some general thoughts. The battery pack itself is very well made, using a durable and hard plastic. Despite being light, it seems like it will take a drop or two without breaking, something I definitely value in a product. A single push on the power button will turn the device on, pressing it twice in quick succession will enable the flash-light mode, and finally pressing and holding will turn the device completely off. The device has a single USB port, although for the size I think that's about perfect. It charges very well - I am able too charge my iPhone 4 three times without fully depleting the charger's battery. Charging the pack itself takes around 10 hours, which is to be expected, and something that you just have to force yourself to remember to do! The charger comes with an Apple connector (30 pin), something that sets it apart from many other chargers!Overall I am very pleased with the YP520A - it is indispensable, well-made, and the small footprint is something that as I mentioned, puts it in the \"every day carry\" category that is hard to reach in my personal collection of electronic devices.

It's actually surprisingly bright for such a small LED.I used this to recharge a Motorola phone which I keep in the car for emergencies (it's a simple flip phone). It took it from 1 power bar to 5 in about 45 minutes. I then charged a SanDisk mp3 player to full from nearly empty in about 30 minutes. Even after that, I still had ample power left in the power bank (it has three status lights to indicate the power level left).It comes with several connectors to help ensure you can hook up a wide range of devices. It would be nice if it came with a carry case to help keep things organized.I'm also pleased to see that it is packaged like the bigger model in that it does not use a hermitically sealed clamshell, but rather an easy to open box and plastic tray. Small issue, but it eliminates the struggle and swearing that usually accompany getting something out of a clamshell.While it lacks a second USB port like the 8400mAh model, the smaller size and the (surprisingly) useful flashlight feature make this well worth considering.

Lebryk", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "The Yubi Power battery is a nice battery.There are a lot of rechargeable USB batteries. They come in all kinds of form factors and capacities. They all have subtle differences in how they charge and the small features that make a difference in day to day use. In the world of batteries I've tested, this is a nice one. Not spectacular, I have to carry this with me every day awesome, but good and serviceable.This is really designed to charge cell phones. If pressed really hard, it does charge an iPad at a somewhat slow rate. The battery is rated for standard USB charging rate, meaning it outputs 1Amp, not 2 like the iPad requires for fast charging. In about four hours, a fully charged Yubi Power took my iPad from 18% to 65% charge. In a pinch, that's a decent amount of charge. On the other hand, an iPhone can be fully charged about three or four times. That is very useful.The big difference with these batteries is the little things. The Yubi does not come with an AC adapter. That's probably not a big deal; in fact most people have too many AC adapters, the type that generates 5V through a USB port. Hint, the little tiny AC adapter that came with the iPhone works just fine. Or a standard computer USB port can be used to charge the battery. At the 1Amp level, or most laptop USB ports and the iPhone adapter, the Yubi takes a long time to fully charge - around six hours.The other big difference is the kinds of wires used to connect to the battery, in other words how do you charge this thing and get power out of it. Yubi has chosen a micro USB port to charge the unit (a universal choice) and standard flat USB for output. From a universality standpoint, this is fantastic - I have a ton of USB cables both Apple dock connector and micro USB. On the other hand, I really hate that micro USB connector. That thing is one of the worst connectors ever made - this is the flat skinny connector found on Kindles and other thin computer hardware. It is easy to get that connector upside down and force it into the socket - I hate the keying. I much more prefer the standard mini USB connector, about the same width, but fatter and a more obvious key with the two wider flanges at the top. The mini USB connector is found on a lot more equipment, portable hard drives, phones, and digital cameras.Yubi adds an LED flashlight that is surprisingly bright. That is a bonus. There are a set of blue LED's to indicate charging, power on, and charge level. I normally love blue lights, I am drawn to just about anything with a blue light. These are somewhat annoying. There is an LED pilot light to show that the battery has a charge. Oddly this is one of the brightest monitor LED's I've ever seen. In a dark room sitting on a table, the light casts a blue light on the ceiling. There is no way to turn off this light. When the battery is being used, more blue LED's light up indicating the charge level. Three is fully charged. These give off even more light at night. In normal daylight they are easy to see.There is one more package in the box, the adapters. The main piece is an eight inch wire with a flat USB connector on one end, and a mini female jack on the other end. There are four different adapters that can be plugged into that socket, a 30 pin iPhone, a micro USB, a mini USB, and what looks like a Nokia or cell phone jack. I'm just not a fan of this arrangement. It is too darn easy to loose these little plugs.Overall, this is a nice battery. It is a nice size and weight. Not necessarily something I'd carry around in my pocket, but could in a pinch. For cell phone power, it is a good choice, and can be pressed into iPad service in a pinch.I was provided a review sample.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good For Cell Phones", "unixReviewTime": 1358208000, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2013"}

For an iPad or similar device, which take a lot more power, you'd be better off with an 8400mAh capacity battery.  When my iPhone 5 registered 6% or 8% battery life remaining, I was able to charge the phone three times without recharging the Yubi.  Yubi claims at least 88% efficiency with the battery, delivering at least 4576 mAh with loss, and given my experience, that figure seems to be accurate.  Other brands have a much higher attrition rate, thus giving you less power for the same size external battery.  Anker, for example, has a 30% power attrition rate on a similarly sized battery.The battery comes with a short (6\") USB cable and adapters (micro-USB, mini-USB, PSP, and standard Apple.)  If you have a different, proprietary connection, such as the lightning connection for iPhone 5 or one for a camera, then you can use those USB cables in place of the supplied ones.  The battery does not come with a wall charger.  While you can technically use your own wall plug, the included USB cable is ridiculously short, and the battery will dangle off the floor.  You're better off using your own cable for that, too, even though that defeats the purpose of having a variety of adapters.The finish is a glossy black, and even though it is a fingerprint magnet, it looks and feels sleek.

I simply used the provided USB cable, plugged it into the Micro USB Input on the charger, and then plugged it into my PC for an overnight charge.  By morning it was fully charged and ready to go.  I've had one portable battery before and do have theYubi 8400 mAh High Capacity Portable Battery.  If you really need some power you might want to consider this Power Bank as it's a real power horse that I'm using with my biggest power hog, the iPad.  It will also charge a couple of devices simultaneously.The 5200 mAh Yubi is no slouch in the power department, but I'm using it primarily for items that don't draw or demand massive amounts of power.  Think Smartphones, Kindles, your GPS, or iPhone.  This Yubi is perfect to leave at work or take with you when you are heading to the library, a bookstore, or anywhere else where you'll need it and don't have access to a plug.  Those critters are out there, but I never manage to be the first one on the scene and once someone is using a plug in a Wi-Fi accessible area, they're reluctant to give them up.Portable devices aren't any good if you can't charge them up and this Yubi is perfect.  It's not only portable, but quite compact.  The LED flashlight is a total bonus, especially if you need a bit of light when you're heading to your car or trying to spot something when the lights go out.  Little touches such as this one are always appreciated.  I do like the accessories, but generally use the ones provided with any particular device I'm using.  The Yubi is high-performance and charged up my Kindle and Kindle Fire as quickly and readily as if I'd plugged it into an outlet in my house.  Good to go on-the-go is an important factor to a lot of us.Needless to say, I've been impressed and pleased with both of my Yubi Power Banks.  If you do need more than 5200 mA, simply check out the very compact and equally affordableYubi 8400 mAh High Capacity Portable Battery.  This Yubi purportedly has life cycle of more than 500 charges.  Durability and long-lasting items are a big plus in my department.  A friend carries a Power Bank to work to keep his phone fully charged.  The Yubi is one of those devices that is powerful, but can fit in the palm of one's hand, can be slipped into a pocket or purse, or into a carrying case.  Absolutely no complaints about either one of the Yubi Power Banks I own.

Chambers", "helpful": [14, 15], "reviewText": "The 5-6-hour battery life typical of many cellphones is barely enough for heavy telephone usage, much less the texting, emails, location services, and apps that drain batteries. Since it's not always possible to be near an AC charger or car charger, an external battery pack is a necessity for many people nowadays. (The recent storms that knocked out electrical power to millions of people is further proof of the need for external battery packs.) In my opinion, there are four key issues to take into account when buying an external battery pack:1. Form factor. I'm including both size and weight. You'll most likely be carrying the charger in your pocket, purse, travel bag, or glove compartment of your vehicle. Smaller and lighter are better.2. Capacity. Rechargers come in a range of capacities from about 2,500 mAh to as high as 12,000 mAh. Figure that 2,300-2,700 mAh is about the equivalent power of a typical rechargeable AA NiMH battery, and that may give you some idea of a battery pack's capacity. Mobile devices will vary a lot in how much capacity it takes to recharge their internal batteries, with the larger tablets requiring considerably more power than a smaller cellphone.3. Reliability. As with any other product, go with brand names you're familiar with, or ones with reviews that you trust.4. Value. Battery packs with higher capacities will generally cost more than ones with smaller capacities. Figure on some tradeoff between size/weight, capacity, and price that fits your budget and gives the capacity you need.---------------------------------------Yubi Power sent me one of their YP520A 5200mAh External Battery Pack units to review. The device appears to be well made, and it was very compact (3.9\" x 1.6\" x 0.8\"). Adapter plugs are included for Apple devices and other devices that have Micro-USB and Mini-USB ports, which include the majority of mobile devices sold today. The output is 5 volts @ 2.1 amps. There's also a flashlight built into the charger.The battery pack can be recharged with an AC wall charger or car charger that provides greater than 500mA. I gave it a full charge in about five hours using a Kindle AC charger (5 volts @ 0.85 amps). Alternatively, the unit can be recharged from the USB port of a PC. Although the battery pack does not include a charger, most users will already have AC wall chargers or car chargers that will work.I tested the Yubi Power battery pack on my Samsung smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD tablet. I was most interested to see how long it required to increase their charge from about 90% to a full 100% charge. With the Kindle Fire HD, it required about 45 minutes; with the smartphone a bit less than a half hour. I also tried recharging my e-Ink Kindle reader, and it recharged it, too.Overall, I'm impressed with the Yubi Power external battery pack. It appears to be well made, it's compact, and it works very well with all of our mobile devices. Considering the size and weight, the 5200 mAh capacity, and the price, it's a very good value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very compact but effective battery pack", "unixReviewTime": 1352851200, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2012"}

Even for use with a Kindle Fire or Nexus 7, this unit can get close to, if not a full charge for these devices.What you must consider when looking to buy a power bank is the mAh the unit can hold, essentially, how much of a charge the power bank can hold total and provide to devices being charged.  This unit has a 5,200 mAh capacity.  Other reviewers have produced great reviews into what devices have what mAh battery.  When considering this unit, if getting a full charge for your device is important, think of this power bank as great for use with cellphones, and most Android tablets.  This unit will add hours of life to your iPad, but it does not have the capacity for a full charge.  There are higher mAh capacity power banks produced by this manufacture but you have to remember for higher mAh capacity, you are also adding weight and size to the power bank unit.Overall, this unit is perfect for the applicable uses.

I think I've only used one that was below expectations.  Most come with a variety of connectors, a charging cable, an embedded LED flashlight.  In those respects, the Yubi Power 5200 mAh meets all standards.FORM FACTORPower banks get smaller all the time.  I remember when 5000 mAh was the size of a small wallet, and I thought that was small.  This one is getting close to the size of some 2500 mAh power banks I've owned.  It is small enough to fit in my jean pocket, a good size for a purse.CONNECTORSManufacturers sometimes go crazy over providing every connector imaginable.  Only a few will ever be used.  Yubi Power provides the most common adapters needed:* iPhone 30 pin connector* micro USB* mini USB* PSPA big plus for providing the iPhone connector.  Only about half the power banks come with one.If your device charges via a USB port but doesn't use one of those connectors, you can connect with your own USB cord.CAPACITY5200 mAh is a good capacity for general purposes.  I prefer it over a 2500 mAh power bank, because it will charge an iPhone more than once.  After charging my iPhone twice, it still had one LED indicator light shining (less than 30% charge remaining).If you have an iPad or other large tablet, I would recommend a 10000 mAh power bank or higher; but for many people on the road, this will be fine.POWER INDICATOR LIGHTSThere are three power indicator lights.  I have to look to find the pinpoints of light.  On most other units, power indicator lights are much more visible.  Two pinpoints of light can indicate anywhere from 30% to 80% charge remaining, which is a wide margin.  The majority of power banks use four indicator lights for more precision.OTHER CONSIDERATIONSSome manufacturers will provide a short charging cord, some a long cord, and some will include both.  A short cord is good for on-the-go.  A long cord is not necessary, but I find it handy for charging the power bank.  This power bank comes with one short charging cord.No pouch is provided.  It is not standard issue, but a nice accessory to include.Like just about all power banks, this one will charge via a USB cord.  It does not come with a USB wall adapter, so you'll need to have a USB charging port available somewhere (computer, wall adapter, USB hub, etc.).  Only some power bank manufacturers will provide the wall adapter.  I find them unnecessary.PROS:+ includes four connectors, including an iPhone connector+ small size, fits in purse or pocket+ good capacity for general purposes, will charge my iPhone at least twice+ embedded LED flashlight+ includes short charging cordCONS:- only 3 power indicator lights- power indicator lights are pinpoint size- does not come with a long charging cord- no pouchSUMMARYThis is a very good basic set.

No other bells or whistles other than the LED \"flashlight\", which is a nice thought, but is too weak to really be useful anywhere other than dropping your keys on the darkest of nights. I wouldn't miss its absence.Along the lines of weak LEDs, the power LEDs are hard to see from a few feet away-- they could be brighter.  There's only one charging output.  There's a set of universal adapters and a short cable, with a small pouch to carry it all.  There's no smell from the unit on first use (many battery units have a chemical scent when first charged up).My only real complaint with this unit is the on/off switch-- I have to turn the unit off after charging it, and turn it on to charge a device (and off when done)-- most powerbanks automatically feed whatever is attached and shut off on their own.It takes a while to charge the powerbank from a 1A AC adapter, maybe 6-8 hours?This kind of handy device fills the \"in transit\" gap, when I'm traveling and haven't gotten to the rental car or hotel yet, but really need my quickly-draining smartphone battery to be working-- charge it up on the go.

And after my experience with 2012's \"Derecho\" storm that left vast areas of my home-state of Maryland without power for days, I also appreciate having additional ways to keep my portable devices charged, when I'm most depending on them.[ I was given this product for the purposes of review.

I will spare the details, but he is no stranger to pushing his phone to the max.  So when he saw this ZeroLemon 7000 mah battery for his Galaxy S3 on Amazon, he was all for it.He realized going in for a battery this size, there would be some size to it and his normal case would never fit, but it did come with a soft plastic back for the phone.  When it arrived he was amazed that it was more like a really large size battery piggy backed on a normal battery.  The case fit on super easy and is a soft plastic which adds much more grip than the stock shiny plastic back that came stock from Samsung.  It looks like it will absorb a fall, but as to how long the case lasts is an unknown.  By the way, he is not adventurous enough to actually drop the S3 to test the back's protection.So he got it all charged and ran it for 24 hours under normal use, including some WiFi tethering and music streaming.  Really a normal day for him.  There was still 48% of the battery left after 24 hours.  For an S3, that is amazing.  Yes, he said it adds some weight and thickness to the phone, but it still fits in his car holder and he just carries it in his pants pocket so it fits fine.So now he is totally in love with this battery and singing its praises.  Then he took a little trip and clicked on the GPS for navigation.  Hmmm, no satellite lock!  Well, S3's are notoriously known for bad for GPS, but  he has always been able to get a lock outside.  He went through possible fixes on line and tightened all the screws, pulled the SIM card yada..yada..yada, but still no satellite lock.  He was not even thinking it was a battery issue until he thought about the size of the battery.  He looked on line and found the GPS antenna placement was in the top left side of the phone looking from the back and it is partially covered by the battery now.Still not wanting to give up the battery, he switched to his old battery and got an instant satellite lock.  Put the new 7000mah battery in and no lock.  Repeat it all again and the problem is always with the new battery.Verdict, it seems this battery just won't allow GPS to work on his phone and he is bummed.  He still uses the battery, only because his need of GPS is seldom, but when travels he will be taking it out.So, if you need GPS, I just can't recommend this battery.  If you don't use GPS, then it is a great choice for a long lasting battery.Disclosure:  I received a sample unit to test and evaluate in exchange for an honest unbiased review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great battery..but whoa, what happened to GPS", "unixReviewTime": 1374192000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2013"}

With my Galaxy S3, I needed to charge twice a day with the stock battery.  Overnight, and again in the afternoon so that I had enough power left to finish out the day.  If I spent the day texting a lot, another charge might be needed by midday.  On really slow days, I was looking at just charging over night.  After popping in the ZeroLemon extended battery, all that changed.  Once fully charged up, heavy days only dropped the battery to ~60%, average days to ~80%, and light days....well...it was still at ~50% two light days later. So now, I might need a charge once every other day.  Given that this battery has several times the capacity as the stock one, this information shouldn't be too surprising.The offset to all the run time is of course the added size and weight that has been added to my S3.  Roughly, it's double thick now with the case on.  And, you're going to have to use the included case, as no one else that I'm aware of makes a case to fit this monster in.  It's not bad though, allowing free access to all the ports and buttons, not to mention fits well.  If you use NFC, have no fear with this battery/case combo.  It works just fine.

This was strictly for app and accessory development - I still use iPhone as my primary phone. After fiddling with several phones I finally settled on Samsung Galaxy SIII as my choice - it had the best price/feature set of all the phones that I've either tested or considered. However, it still has a fair share of shortcomings (and I'll probably write about those in another review). One of the more noticeable shortcomings was its unacceptably short battery life. Even on the full standby mode the battery would die after only little over a day of use. And this is without me even setting up the cell phone coverage! So when an opportunity presented itself to check out a bigger capacity battery I immediately decided to seize the opportunity.So far I have been really impressed with this ZeroLemon extended battery. It has about three times the capacity of the standard S III battery, and my rough estimate of its life on a single charge is that it's about two to three times longer than what you normally get. The estimate is only rough since the usage and circumstances may vary from day to day and from an individual to individual. In terms of battery capacity I am definitely impresses with this product.This extended battery attaches to your cell phone by removing the back cover and the standard battery. The ZeroLemon battery is too physically large to fit inside the regular cover, and hence the back of your phone needs to be covered with the included TPU cover. This is an effective, albeit not very elegant solution. The new cover dramatically alters the look and feel of your phone. Also, even though I have not had any problems with it so far, the cover doesn't feel as securely and snugly in place as a snap-on cover that fits in the back. I've seen some other products out there that completely place the extended battery inside of an external cover, which to me seems like a sturdier solution.The cover leaves all of your main ports accessible, but it covers the side buttons with its own version of the same. These are effective, but not as responsive as the \"bare\" buttons on the phone itself.The extended battery also makes your phone noticeably thicker and heavier. However, if neither the extra bulk nor the esthetical look of your phone are not a concern for you, and you really need all the extra power that you can get, then this battery/cover combo will do the trick. I am still not sure how well it performs in the long run, but when I find out I'll try to post an update to this review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid, Capacious Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S III", "unixReviewTime": 1376265600, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2013"}

However I write unbiased reviews and will not risk my reputation as a reviewer for the sake of a free item.This review is for the 18600mAh external power pack. Some reviews here seem to be for other items.This battery pack is slim and not very large considering its capacity. It weighs in at 9 ounces on my kitchen scale. That's heavy enough to be noticed but light enough not to be a burden in a briefcase.You charge this pack via an external USB power source (not provided). Depending on the source you use, charging can take a while, something like a &#34;long overnight&#34; of 12 hours or so. This is in line with expectations.There are two outputs, one a 2A and the other at 1A. Both can be used simultaneously. If you're not in a hurry and are charging a single device, use the 1A output for less heat at the cost of slower charging.Three lights on the pack indicate the approximate state of charge. When you're charging up the pack, three solid lights mean a full charge (although I always charge an extra hour beyond this point, as this type of indication system is approximate at best). On discharge, the lights tell you in very rough terms how much power is left. It also is only visible when actually charging or discharging. You can't press a button, as with some other power packs, to check the state of charge.The unit comes with a single cord, USB to micro-D, which is a standard charging cord. Most of its length is coiled, which makes for easy and neat storage. If you have an Apple or other device that doesn't use micro-D, you use the cord that came with your device. My unit did not come with instructions, either.Given that the unit is quite portable and simple in design so that usage is easy, how much can you get out of it? Typically, you ought to expect 70 to 80% efficiency and charging down to about 10% residual power. That would mean you'd get, in round numbers, about 12500mAh of actual charging power. I tried this out in a consistent mode, using it nightly to charge my Droid X. Based on the way I use the Droid X, to make a long story short I would expect 18 days of charging. That's quite a lot, and I actually got 20 days in the one test I ran (it takes too long to do multiple runs). So power output is somewhat better than expected. 20 days of charging is a long time to be able to use a cell phone without touching an AC outlet. (Keep in mind that I don't drain the Droid X beyond 50-60% most days.)More power-hungry devices will of course yield less running time. A modern &#34;large&#34; smartphone should get about half the run time as my less demanding phone, and a tablet maybe a quarter, but this very much depends on usage patterns. You should be able to deliver just about two full charges (from battery-out shutdown) to a typical tablet.Zerolemon offers a 36 month warranty, which is amazingly long for a power pack.This is a good power pack to take on a long trip, like backpacking, where you'll be away from AC power but still in range of a cell tower. It is also good to have for emergencies such as storms, when power can be out for days. You'll be able to keep two cellphones running for the course of a relatively long power outage. This can be a very significant safety feature.Summary of pros:-Delivers advertised capacity-Easy to use and suitable for a variety of use cases-Highly portable-Very long warrantySummary of cons:-No instructions-Power level indicator very approximate and only visible when charging or dischargingOverall, a very good unit backed by a strong warranty, and easily merits a five-star rating.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Portable, powerful, easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2014"}

This holder offers both, and includes both the suction cup and the adhesive disc for both mounting options.The phone/GPS cradle easily held each of an HTC Evo 4G, and HTC Evo Shift (both with their protective cases, one hardshell and one rubber) and a Garmin Nuvi 1300 1300LM. The cradle rotates 360 degrees, with an audible click/detent about every 12 degrees. The ball and socket connector between the cradle and the mount moves through more than 90 degrees.Overall, very solid feel. If you use a windshield suction mount or prefer a permanent dash mount, this would be a good choice.Note: This product was provided to me by the vendor for purposes of this review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If you like windshield or permanent mounts: works fine...,", "unixReviewTime": 1354838400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2012"}

The phone also has a skin on that adds to its sickness.I am attaching a collage of 5 photos that I will be referencing in this review. You can find the  photos by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo of this listing.Bolse windshield mount is pretty compact and I was not sure how well it would fit the phone as with its extra fat battery and skin it is pretty big. Photo #5 shows the fit.  To my surprise it worked!  I would say this pushed the capacity of this holder to its limit. If the  phone was any larger or thicker I would be worried that the grip would not hold.Photo #1 shows a close up of the grip of the holder. I put a circle around the arm that expands to grasp the phone.  The mounts grasps the phone on the sides while leaving ports exposed. This means the phone can be plugged in if you are using it as a GPS that uses a lot of battery power.The way this holder mounts on the windshield is different from other mounts that I have tried. Others create suction by a lever, this one is attached by rotating the base. The unit came with no instructions, and it took some fussing in the car to figure out how to mount it, especially since it was different from other mounts we have used in the past.The mount comes in two pieces, the base and the grips. I found that I got the strongest hold when I attached the base first, then mounted the phone to the grips (photo #5) and then mounted the grips onto the base.  I have a small piece of soap stored in the car, which together with my spit gives my windshield mounts a good grip.I really liked the flexibility and ease with which I could rotate and angle the mount.  Photo #2 and photo #3 show the phone positioned in different orientations as well as with different angles.  The mount gives you full 360 degree of freedom for positioning the phone.Update after several weeks of use: Bolse phone cradle mounts very close to the windshield, it has a shorter extension than the other windshield mounts we own.  Depending on the slope of your windshield this could keep your phone fairly far from the driver.  My car's electric plug is positioned fairly close to the floor level and the length of the charging cord for the phone also restrict where I can attach this mount.  The combination of these two aspects puts the phone into a position that makes it hard for me to make out street names on the map if I use the phone for navigation.  Someone with good eye sight will not have any issues, but my I wanted to update the review to add this note for those who don't have great eyes.The mount also comes with a second option for mounting with an adhesive disk (which also has tiny screw holes) to mount the holder on the dash permanently.  I don't like using permanent mounts for a number of reasons: I don't want to damage my car with permanent screw holes or hard to remove glue. I also rather not have anything permanent suggesting to passers by that the car might have \"interesting\" electronics hidden away.  I have not tried the adhesive disk and cannot comment on how well it works.I received an evaluation unit for test from manufacture to write an honest and unbiased review. I have described positives and negatives of my experience with this unit and if you have any questions on the features I covered I am always happy to respond to comments.Overall I am pleased with the unit, particularly how easy to is to change the orientation and position of the phone.

The cup appears very shallow and I couldn't quite see how it would create the proper seal to hold my iPhone. After reading through the included information, I found that after pressing the suction cup up against the glass, you then turn the rotating base, creating a tight suction against the glass. Cleaning the glass well first to remove any dust/dirt definitely helps in getting the best results. I tested this out first inside my home on one of my mirrors. The mount was able to stay attached all day. However outside, we are entering into the heart of winter here in Minnesota, and it is quite cold.

By \"get rid\" I mean relegate it to the back of our glove compartment which is as good as for us! The only thing left to figure out was a good solution for holding an iPhone to use as our GPS. I would like to thank LowerPriceUSA for providing me a copy of this holder for evaluation purposes, in exchange for an honest review.IN THE BOX- Phone holder attached to swivel/tilt base- Smooth mounting plate with adhesiveBUILD/QUALITYDespite being a relatively inexpensive accessory, the quality of this device matches the mount that came with our $150+ Garmin GPS. The holder has a soft foam material that grips your device without harming it. After giving the dashboard a good cleaning, I stuck the mounting plate on using the adhesive. It stayed nicely and I will update this review as necessary. I also tried mounting it directly to the windshield, and while I prefer to have it on the dash so it doesn't obstruct the view, the suction cup kept it nicely in place.DESIGNWhat I really like about this holder is the way that it swivels and tilts. This means you can switch from landscape to portrait with ease, something you may need to do depending on your GPS app. Your phone will be held in via tension, and was large enough for an iPhone 4 with a case. As mentioned in the description, the holder fits phones with a width of 2\" - 3.3\", so I would suggest checking your phone before buying. Once mounted, there was no slipping that I could see - there is enough tension on both the swivel and tilt mechanisms that the iPhone stayed where I put it!OVERALLFor the price, this is an excellent accessory! It is well made, functions as promised and has ended my search for something that allows me to use my phone instead of my GPS. It seems as though the Garmin is going to stay in the glove compartment!------------------------------------COLD WEATHER TIPSOne of the reasons I don't like having anything on the windshield is that the cold really does mess with the efficiency of suction cups. It has little to do with the quality of the suction cup, and more to do with the physics of freezing and evaporation which (without some help) are mostly unavoidable. Below are some tips for those of you that understandably don't want to permanently stick something to their car:Method 1:Clean both the suction cup and the target area with glass cleaner. If applying to a cold windshield, blast the defogger for a few minutes while warming the suction cup with your hands, a seat warmer etc. Once both are reasonably warm, push HARD to stick suction cup. This won't work forever, but will work better than a cold suction cup.Method 2:Clean both areas, and apply a TINY bit of baby oil to the suction cup. Oil has a much lower freezing point than water, and also will evaporate at a much slower rate. This will keep the vacuum stronger and more durable. Too much baby oil, and your GPS/phone will start to slide down, so just use a little!Method 3:There are products  on the market for this very purpose. I haven't tested this particular one, but if you're willing to spend a few bucks to keep your expensive electronics safe, it has decent reviews:MawMaws Suck-It-Up Suction Cup Securing Liquid", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Couldn't really ask for more!", "unixReviewTime": 1354752000, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2012"}

My windshield is too sloped to use it there, so I attached it using a disk I had already installed for my GPS unit.  There, I had to adjust it to keep the weight of the phone from gradually pulling the viewing angle downward.  If you look at the product photo, you'll see that the iPhone is angled upward, but that requires either a low dashboard or a tall driver, preferably both.To use the suction cup, you must start with a clean surface.  It is even easier if one surface is damp.  You twist the base clockwise to attach the suction cup.  Just like GPS devices that use suction to install, the device will occasionally fall off with drastic temperature changes or dirty surfaces.  The side arms grip the phone tightly -- so tightly that I feared that they would crack my iPhone 5 with the pressure.  (They didn't.)  The arms are padded to keep them from scratching your phone.  The best part of this product is the mobility -- side-to-side, up-and-down, and everything in-between.  The ball joint allows the use to orient the phone exactly as she pleases.  Of course, this is also the feature that allows the arms to drift downward.For an occasional mount to use a smart phone as a navigation device, this is a decent option, especially if you have a windshield that allows a direct mount at a slightly upward angle.

Also, I have not had the best experience with attaching this holder to anything but smooth, clean glass surfaces. It also probably helps that I am using it during the mild California winter - in my experience with other suction cups and windshield mounts they tend to come off in summer or really cold winter weather.The smartphone holding area is very versatile and can hold most smartphones that are available today. I would not try it with Galaxy Note or an even larger device, but short of that it should work well for most smartphones.The range of positions that you can put your smartphone in is one of this mount's greatest features. You can practically adjust it for almost any viewing angle, and it's relatively easy to adjust these angles while you are driving.The biggest shortcoming of this mount is its extension. It is a very small mount, and it will keep your smartphone very close to the windshield. This is problematic for two reasons. First, the visibility of the smaller smartphone screens will be diminished to the point of being useless. This could potentially be a safety hazard.

With every mount I have tried, I have found both good and bad things with regards to functionality and design.  The Bolse Mini Windshield Car Mount has been a pleasant experience in comparison to most comparable mounts in this price range and unit size.The design of the Bolse mount appears to give you the most flex and rotation possible in such a compact mount.  There are some aspects of the mount with respect 'grip' and 'rotation' that I have concern with.  For those who like to grab their device and go, the phone/device gripping mechanism can require a little extra effort to release, especially for those who use rubber cases on their phone.  Nothing major, but it does require a couple more seconds to release; with that in mind though, the security of hold is spectacular.  I have absolutely no concerns that when my device is secured in the mount it could/might fall or come out.Suction to the window/dash is reasonably great.  I've had no issues with the holder coming loose from either the window or dash while driving.  I did use an alcohol prep pad to clean the surface first, which is often strongly recommended for creating the best bond.  Currently with the winter weather, there has been a morning or two I have come out and found the mount had popped loose from the windshield, but with extremely cold weather, I haven't been overly concerned.  I've had similar experiences with other suction cup mounts (radar detector, GPS, etc.) and can only blame it on the weather, not so much the mount.Something I have wanted to try, was to use this mount to hold a digital camera for the purposes of capturing video out the front windshield while driving.  I mounted the holder just below the rearview mirror and pointed it out with a digital camera secured inside.  The video I captured was fantastic, however there was slight bumping in the video (unit wasn't as ridged in keeping position, but that can be blamed on uneven roads and potholes).

It is easy to remove, fold it up and put it in your bag. It works by rotating the base to activate the suction or to loosen it.  I live in Virginia, our for-season weather sometimes makes the suction cup looses its holds with the changing temperature. What I do is I normally mount it on the dashboard.

As a practical matter I would not mount anything on my windshield anyhow because the presence of a mount or the telltale marks it leaves when you remove it is just an advertisement to a potential thief, who may break into your car looking for an electronic gizmo not knowing that you have taken it with you.I also don't like using sticky friction mount tape on my leather dashboard because if you decide to stop using the gizmo, that tape always leaves a mark. Also, using friction tape makes it impractical to keep switching the mount between different cars, which is something I want to be able to do.So when I received this at no cost from the manufacturer in exchange for writing a review, I knew that I would not be putting this on the windshield. This does work, but maybe not all year round depending where you live. Here is what to keep in mind.1. I always deduct a star for a product that comes with no instructions. In fact I am glad that another reviewer did a video review to remind me how to adjust the suction cup. It's been so long since I used one of these devices that I had forgotten. And if you never used a mount, instructions would be nice.2. Another reviewer correctly notes that suction cups don't work well in cold weather. There is either difficulty getting them to stick in the first place, or to stay on once in place. I had that exact same difficulty, and wound up positioning this in a storage bin in my console. I like having my phone in this holder rather than just laying in the storage bin.3. This accommodates various size phones. It accomplishes that by having a spring loaded mechanism that you just push apart to fit your phone. It is easy to put the phone in and take it out.4. I use this on an iPhone 4S in a thin case, and it works just fine. I can easily insert the charging cord into the bottom of the phone while it is in this holder.5. Although you cannot adjust the tension on the ball pivot, with a phone as light as an iPhone 4S that is not an issue. And I'm not sure if there is a cell phone heavy enough where the lack of that adjustment would be a problem.6. I can easily remove this to use in another car.Bottom line: This works okay, but may not be practical to use in the winter months if you live in the Northeast where we get frigid winters or some other part of the country with similar winter weather because the suction mount will not work well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works okay", "unixReviewTime": 1355011200, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2012"}

They come in a small pack of four, and they are easily removed from the packaging card.  You put your chosen sticker over the home button of your phone (I have an iPhone 5, and it fits), and press into place.  Although they are easier to place than a screen protector, I did have to place and remove a few times to get the inner home symbol aligned to my liking.I like that these are aluminum, not plastic or paper, because it makes the button feel like it could be part of the original equipment.  It also resists scratches and dings from fingernails.  Once in place, the button does not slide.  It does take a little bit of effort to remove, but once I got a bit of fingernail under the disk, the whole thing lifted off without leaving behind any residue.These are marketed in part as a \"protection\" for the home button, although I question how much that's really needed.  They raise the button area, making the button slightly easier to find without looking than the iPhone's recessed home button.  Again, I'm not sure how many people need one for that reason.  To me, the real reason for purchasing these is to personalize the look of the iPhone, something many people, particularly teenagers and young adults, like.  If you coupled, say, the pink one with a pink or otherwise matching case, then the iPhone would feel uniquely yours.  Because these are stickers, don't expect to change the colors frequently  They aren't meant to be used as a daily fashion choice since their stickiness will be compromised by multiple uses.

These type of stickers are probably for the kid at heart in all of us.  They aren't really expensive, but have that delightful charm I really couldn't resist.  My problem was trying to decide which sticker I was going to put on my iPad.  I finally settled on the purple (of course) and put it on my home button.  When removing the stickers from their paper storage holder, simply slip the tip of your fingernail beneath one edge and pull lightly. The easiest way to position the sticker is to lick your pointer finger to get it into the position you want, carefully apply, and press it down.If you miss and get it into a position you don't like, simply pull the sticker off and start again.  Some people are actually collecting these reusable stickers to personalize their iOS devices.  The FRIEQ home button stickers are quite functional in one regard.  If you are trying to find your home button in a darkened room, the colored buttons make it quite easy to spot.  The purple sticker adds a bit of charm to my iPad and when I get tired of it, I can easily swap it out for a different color.The nice thing about these home button stickers is that they are made of 100% aluminum.  As I mentioned before, they are reusable, a factor to keep in mind if you are counting your pennies.  They are also lightweight and scratch-resistant (I tried).

After three and a half years of owning the comparatively bulky iPhone 3GS, with an even bulkier case, I have been enjoying the sleek look of my new iPhone 5 over the past month.  I have not yet even put a case on the phone because I love the clean, simple look.  I thought that this product might mar that look, but I was very pleasantly surprised when I applied it to my phone a week ago.The first thing to note is that these are not \"stickers,\" as most of us think of the term. They are a very thin, quality-looking aluminum.  The silver, blue, and magenta (called purple in the product description, but not how I would describe it) stickers have a slight (i.e. not gaudy) metallic hue, while the black has a glossier-look.I decided I would go all out with the magenta, and I love the look and feel.  It fits right into the indentation of the home button, with the edge of the sticker slightly raised so that you can identify the button by feel.  I actually think the home button is easier to use with this sticker - it seems to take a lighter amount of pressure to get the home button activated.  Due to a family incident that occurred a week ago, I have had this phone in my hand on a near-constant basis: making calls, texting, e-mailing, using the internet.  The button has stayed firmly in place.I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to add a simple dose of style to their iPhone, iPad, or iTouch, at a great price (currently) at just over $2 per sticker.

The inside of the case is a rubber shell.  The exterior is a thin plastic shell that covers all but about 3/4\" at the top and the bottom of the phone.  I have two of the colors: semi-gloss black and gunmetal.  The black is nice, but the gunmetal is the most attractive case I've ever seen for any of my iPhones.Installing the case is simple, so if you like to swap out cases, this won't be too much of a chore for you.It also comes with three glossy \"jelly bean\" stickers to add some bling to the home button: one orange, one white, and one black.I like the minimalist protection from this case.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great iPhone 5 case", "unixReviewTime": 1367539200, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2013"}

Still, I need to protect my phone.  This Spigen case is a fantastic example of a case that can look almost naked, subtly two-toned, or distinctive, depending on which model you choose.  I love mine; however, because I have two Slim Armor cases, one (gunmetal) that fits and works perfect and one (metal slate) that doesn't fit right, quality control may be an issue; read on for details.First, make no mistake:  this is not a heavy-duty case designed to encase your phone in thick rubber and plastic.  It makes the iPhone only slightly thicker while protecting the back, sides, and buttons.  There are adequate cut-outs for camera, speakers, control, and cables with button covers for the volume control that somehow work despite going through the removable backplate and the main frame.  The gunmetal color provides a subtle contrast between the black of the main case and the matte gray of the plate.  In most light, the contrast is slightly more evident than it is in the product photo.The case is easy to slip on and off, and the plate is easy to swap in and out to change the color of your case without changing the actual case.  (You can buy replacement backplates in a variety of colors.)  I like this exchangeable backplate design because I can change the look of my phone in mere seconds.This would have been a five-star product if I had only the gunmetal case.  Or it would have been a one-star product if I had only the metal slate version.  When I inserted my iPhone 5 into the metal slate case, it didn't fit properly.  No matter what I did, one side of the screen didn't fully fit and was slightly lifted, making the glass vulnerable on the edge.  I decided to pop my phone into the other case to see whether the bad fit was a design flaw or a defect.  It immediately became clear that the problem was a manufacturing defect of millimeters.  If you decide to buy this case and if it doesn't fit right or if the buttons aren't properly aligned, exchange for a new one.  This case can and should fit perfectly.I really love this case on my black iPhone 5 for its elegance,  If you are looking for maximum protection, however, look elsewhere.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Low-Profile Protection with Changeable Backplate", "unixReviewTime": 1366934400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2013"}

Indeed, my expectations were justified, and this is one of my favorite such batteries. In fact, in terms of the combination of price, capacity, size and design it might be my single favorite such battery.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare.

I was also able to charge two devices simultaneously.To fully charge this battery it takes about six hours. This is much longer than some other such batteries that I have tested, and I think this is primarily due to the fact that it relies on USB connection for powering. The best way to charge this battery is to leave it plugged in overnight. You can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone USB charger.Incredicharge battery is very well designed and very compact. It's slightly thicker than two iPhone 4/4S, and about as long as those. It looks very elegant and sophisticated, and it is not out of place even with the most fancy consumer electronic devices.

Others come with nothing but the bare minimum, or maybe they'll have accessories like a carry pouch, or added perks like an onboard LED light. Some have multiple USB ports, some have onboard charging cords.Pay attention to the amperage of the ports. They are usually either 1 or 2 amps. If you only have a 1 amp port, be prepared for a slower charge.The Incredicharge I-10 comes with following adapters:* 30-pin Apple* mini USB* Nokia* Galaxy* USB A to micro USB cableIt also includes an onboard micro USB cable, neatly stored. Micro USB is the most universal connector. If that's all you need, you will never be without the proper cable.No pouch nor LED flashlight is included. Although I think a flashlight feature would be superfluous, a pouch would be nice.I plugged in Kindle Fire HD 8'9\" tablet, my Kindle 3G, and my iPhone 4S. That overwhelmed it and it turned off. I thought that meant it could only charge two device at once. However, if I replace the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet with my generic 9\" Android tablet, it charges three devices just fine. So, it can charge up to three devices at once, depending on what they are.Charging one at a time, the power bank can give my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet a full charge with enough juice left over to give my iPhone 4S a 60% boost.The Incredicharge is attractive and well-built, as compact as a 10400 mAh power bank can be - about the size of a small men's wallet. I recommend it for tablet owners. It's easy enough to carry around, but heavier than what I'd want to always have at the ready in my purse. I keep it in my car instead. For those who don't need that kind of capacity, there are smaller \"lipstick\" style power banks that have just enough oomph to power a cell phone and are small enough to carry anywhere.My brother saw this power bank and was impressed. He's used a lot of power banks and liked the look of this one.

The case is flat so if you are measuring your device you need to allow room for thickness as well as length + width.I used Nexus Galaxy phone for testing. Several notes about the phone. The Nexus Galaxy phone is not officially listed as a phone which would fit into this case. However Nexus Galaxy phone is similar in size to Galaxy SIII and Galaxy SI SGH-T989 (it fits cradles made for these phones). In addition Nexus Galaxy phone is normally used with an extra large battery (Hyperion Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus 3800mAh Extended Battery) which makes it significantly fatter than a standard battery.I tested both configurations with the large battery as well as with the large battery removed (so the phone would be the thickness of the phone with a regular battery). Not surprisingly, the case was a good fit without the extra large battery. The larger battery was not a good fit. It was so tight that I stopped the insertion in fear of tearing the case.Whether you like water sports, skiing, or just want to keep the phone dry in a pouring rain this case will do a nice job. If you are using an extra large battery on your phone this case is not a good fit. I am not deducting stars for not fitting the extra large battery, however, since the product description did not state that it would fit.

There's no way that I could afford to replace my iPhone (received via contract) and so a product of this nature HAD to work. There are many MANY horror stories about waterproof enclosures of all kinds - indeed Amazon reviews are the main reason I haven't purchased a cheaper enclosure for my DSLR despite a burning desire to start underwater photography! So with some trepidation, I tested the product. I would like to thank LowerpriceUSA for sending me a copy of this product for reviewing purposes.BUILD/QUALITYWell, the good news is that this case is made of good quality plastic. Giving it a through inspection I was pleased to see that any seams were about an inch wide, meaning that an inch of glue (or whatever they used to seal it) would have to fail before any moisture got in. I was intrigued by the top closing mechanism - it didn't look very secure at all, but if you can imagine a sandwich bag with the press-to-lock seal, and then imagine a clamp locked into place over that, you will have a good idea of how water is shut out.DESIGNHappily, I want to report that the touch-screen is still fully functional with this case on. This means that you don't have to open the case when in wet/sandy/dirty/snowy conditions, and still have full use. Now obviously it's a little hard to push buttons on the top and sides (at least it is on the iPhone), but it's still doable, and the home button is easily pressed. The clear plastic on both sides means that you will still have the use of front and back cameras...it looks like my underwater photography dreams may begin to come true! The two rotating locks are relatively hassle-free, although it takes some getting used to.PERFORMANCEAnd now we get to what's most important: does it work? There's no point buying a well-made, stylish waterproof case if it doesn't keep water out! The first thing I did was load up some regular facial tissues into the case and seal it. I then went to the sink and ran water directly over the top seal for a good few minutes. After drying it off completely (to make sure the outside wasn't a source of moisture), I opened it up and was pleased to find the tissues still bone-dry. Encouraged, I closed it back up and this time submerged the case in the sink for 10 minutes. Again, I was very pleased with the results! Finally, I put my phone in (fingers crossed/praying fervently/etc.) and submerged it again. I was VERY happy to see that not a drop of water had entered the case, and that I could still use the touch-screen underwater! Now I haven't tested the claims that it is effective to 100ft, but I may just have to load it up with an old iPod and give it a shot this summer! It is also important to note that by leaving some air in when sealing the case, this will actually float - perfect for those using this while boating etc.OVERALLI don't think I would ever recommend a water-proof enclosure for electronics without some sort of reservation, but so far the case survived the sink test, and I think for beach/boating/all-weather use it will be just fine. As far as it being your snorkeling partner, I will let someone with more experience comment on that.

If you need to protect your phone from water, this is the way to go for the least money and easiest to use case.The trick with this case, it won't fit tightly and be bubble free against the phone. Using the touchscreen takes a little time to get used to the extra layer of plastic. You won't be able to type as fast as with no case.This case will work with iPhone 4 through 5. It is just about the easiest case to install. Flip two switches on the front of the case. Separate the two plastic parts, slip your phone into the bag, and try to squeeze out the air, close the two plastic parts, and flip the switches. It is really that easy to put on. The opening is sealed if those two switches are fully inserted and the tabs point outward.All the controls work fine through the case - volume, power, reset, and the home button. Of course you can't charge the phone or use headphones with the case in place. For reasons I will never understand, you can hear the speaker very well with this - it doesn't change the volume very much at all.The case is waterproof, it doesn't leak. I'm not sure I would use this diving to 100 feet. On the other hand, if I accidentally dropped my phone in a pool or lake, I'd be super happy that the phone was protected.I've used a waterproof case with my iPad for a very long time. That case is made of much more robust material. The vinyl is covered with a fabric that makes it virtually indestructible. The clear plastic is about twice as thick. And the seal at the top is a double ultra heavy zip lock style closure. I trust that I could abuse that case a lot and it would still work fine. The Frieq case is made of much thinner vinyl - about the thickness of pool toys. The seams look like they are welded very well. For the long haul, I'm not sure this will stand up to a lot of abuse. This seems more like a really great inexpensive a few time use case as opposed to something long term.I wouldn't hesitate to use this for camping or protecting my phone from rain. I wouldn't use it diving for a long time. It works perfectly for taking underwater pictures in say a pool.

It's huge -- I guess to make it universal -- and my iPhone 5 looks small inside, but that also means I have a little room for money and an ID.

I can swipe, call, check email, etc. without taking it out of the pouch.Of course, I didn't want to test this on my iPhone in case it didn't work.  I folded up a square of tissue paper, inserted it, flipped the latches closed, and submerged it in water for a hour.  Since tissue paper picks up water easily, I expected to see a few drops through the window.  There was nothing, not a drop.  The only time it got wet was when I opened the latches and pulled it out.

A waterproof case that still allows you to work your smart phone and take pictures?  The manufacturer states that this is waterproof to 100 feet, making me feel more secure when using it outdoors.

So when I go camping, canoeing or lying at the beach, I can take my (iPhone 4S) and still play with it and take nice outdoor photos.The FRIEQ has a very tight seal at the top that takes a little concentration to open and close it. Both sides are completely clear for seeing and using your iPhone (yes, you can still use your apps through the plastic window).  For carrying, there is a small hole at the top for a lanyard.  FRIEQ states that this will protect your phone down to 100 feet.  As a SCUBA diver, I don't doubt this (but won't test it).  What happen is the deeper you go, the greater the water pressure, meaning a tighter seal.  Most leaks occur on the top twenty-five feet of water with these kinds of devices.  Also, just like the buttons/levers on those throw-away underwater cameras that don't work past the recommended depth, your apps on your phone won't work well at a deeper depth.  This waterproof case is best used no deeper than twenty feet.When you think of how much time and effort and use you put into your smart phone, this ten dollar protection unit is a no-brainer. If you really want to test it, you could snorkel or leave it out in the rain when camping.  This is one of the best inventions for full outdoor protection for your smart phone.

Your device will be protected from water in this completely waterproof case.The Frieq waterproof case will handle smartphones up to about 5.3 inches. I have an iPhone 4. I like that the clear panel on both sides of the case lets me see and use the touchscreen nearly as easily as if the phone were not in the case. I can still take photos and video through the case too which is really cool. In the past when kayaking, I'd have my iPhone with me in a ziplock sandwich bag. It worked fairly well for protecting against splashes but there was one time where my phone fell into the water and the zip wasn't locked. Water got in the bag, but didn't damage the phone since I was pretty quick retrieving the bag. I was very lucky that time. Now that I have this waterproof case, I will feel much more comfortable taking my iPhone with me in my kayak.This is really great for protecting your smartphone whenever you know you're going to be on or near water. Or how about while hiking or camping and you get caught in a downpour. The case is rated IPX-8 which means it is rated for complete submersion and is waterproof up to 100 feet for up to 30 minutes. I'm not so sure I'd trust this to protect my phone while scuba diving but maybe while snorkeling. It's certainly going to keep your phone dry from rain, accidental drops in water, etc.The clips that close the case are a little finicky to operate but not too bad. It takes a leap of faith to actually put your phone in this then deliberately submerge it but it's rated IPX-8 so that is the assurance that it can handle it. There is also a neck strap/lanyard included for carrying the case.This is great and inexpensive insurance for protecting your smartphone, small camera, mp3 player or other small electronic device from dunks. I'm a little surprised that there was no instructions included in the package but I guess it's fairly obvious how to open and close the clasps.

It's funny how some people aren't bothered by the fingerprints while others, like me, are. I've noticed that after a few hours of looking \"through\" fingerprints, my eyes are more fatigued than normal. So I try to keep my screens clean.Since I also wear glasses, I usually have the small cloths they give you at the optometrists office to clean my glasses. I'd try to use those tiny cloths to clean my iPad screen and it just didn't work. They are simply too small to really be effective. Plus just one cleaning of the iPad screen makes the tiny cloth so dirty that it can't really clean my glasses very effectively anymore. The other option was to use one of those ginormous micro-fiber shop cloths... wow those sure are convenient to carry with you aren't they?So along comes Frieq with these perfectly sized little cleaning pads. They are micro-fibre, they have a convenient pouch you can slide your fingers into and you can wash them when they get too dirty to work effectively. Plus, you get 3 of them in a package. Cool. My only tip is when you wash them, do not use fabric softener otherwise you will leave a haze of fabric softener on your screen when you attempt to clean the screen.I think these are a brilliant solution to a \"problem\" I didn't even know I had.

I tested it against my gold standard Fuzzy Wuzzy on a particularly messy screen.  They both took three swipes to clean it.

My husband can fit two fingers comfortably, three if I asked him to.It's not necessary to use the pouch or to insert all digits.  The cloth can always be grabbed from the outside and used like any other regular cleaning cloth.  Placing the fingers inside merely helps me position my hand flat against the screen and apply more even pressure against a greater surface area (i.e., I clean more screen more quickly).This is a good size cloth for me, more portable than my Fuzzy Wuzzy, which is too big a clump in my purse.

It is hefty and thick - something that could either be good or bad depending on what you are looking for! I would like to thank LowerpriceUSA for sending me a sample of this stylus to evaluate.QUALITYWell, I usually like to start my reviews with the quality of an item, and let me begin by saying that the FRIEQ Wide Grip stylus loses no points here. It is made of a nice (heavy) aluminum that feels good in the hand. The rubber tip is thicker than many other styli that I have tried, and seems less prone to wear. I will, of course, update after further use. The stylus comes in a nice black box, making this ideal as gift to that techy in your life!DESIGNWell, this is honestly where the Wide Grip stylus lost one star. Beginning with what I love about the design, I would like to mention that I LOVE thicker styli. I am a daily user of a Wacom graphics tablet, and so switching from a thicker pen to a thin stylus has always had an air of unnaturalness to me. I find the FRIEQ stylus very easy and natural to hold, much more than holding the typical thinner styli available on the market. I also like the weight to it - again I find this more comfortable over time! There are two main concerns that I have with the design. The first is that the beautiful aluminum finish is very hard to hold on to, generally speaking. Especially during the winter - dry hands are almost certain with central heating going and using an easily dropped and heavier stylus over a $400 iPad is a little too much of a liability. I'm not saying that this FRIEQ stylus is hazardous by any means - I just feel as though I am constantly having to check my grip. The second concern is that the tips don't seem to be replaceable - something that I may or may not care about depending on how long the stylus lasts.PERFORMANCEI can honestly say that I had no issue using the FRIEQ stylus. It has a thicker tip, meaning it is not ideal for phones use, however it definitely works as it should and is an absolute joy on tablets. I had no problems with jerky movements (i.e. you're trying to draw a straight line and it jumps), and in terms of performance I have no complaints!OVERALLI would love to see the manufacturers take a little width out of the center of the stylus, replacing it with a rubberized grip, but other than that I really like this stylus, and it has become my new favorite in terms of usability! I would highly recommend this as a cheap experiment for anyone looking for something a little sturdier in a stylus - you may just fall in love with it!

This one, which is similar to theuNu Aero Seriestries to make a balance between adding size and being of value, while at the same time trying to work within the limitations of what what can do with the fruit of Apple.  Like the Aero series, I think uNu did a good job at meeting their goals with this product, but could have done a couple of things better.  The case itself is a nice snug fit, not easily dislodged once it's wrapped around your phone.  Fatter than the Aero Series model, true, but packing a bit more battery too.  For whatever reason, uNu decided against using a lightening connector on the outside of the case for charging and syncing, and went with micro USB instead.  You can still charge and sync, no problem, but if you bought extra lightening cables, extra iPhone specific cables, those are going ot be useless with this case.  Due to the the iPhone not having a user replaceable battery, the DX case acts as its own entity. Clearly written in the instructions, it's made plain that in order to get the extra juice, one must manually turn it on.  For those that...uhm...don't read instructions, it's not at all obvious.  It would be nice if the whole thing worked together with the phone a bit better.  Like maybe an app that could monitor the phone's battery and then kick on the extra one as needed.  Not being an Apple developer myself, I suspect that Apple does not allow the level of access to the hardware needed to make this possible.  Also worthy of note, when charging, the phone's battery charges first, then the external.  Always.  Further, the external battery has its own charge level indicator.

I kinda forgot about the convenience of those, and moved instead to external power banks as a source of back-up power. With the uNu Power DX, I'm back!

The uNu Power DX keeps my iPhone up and running for twice as long.The fit is perfect, and the lightning connector goes into the phone smoothly and firmly.  The top and bottom sections meet without noticeable gaps -- other than a thin seam, of course.  Because the case charges using a microUSB connection, you don't need an extra lightning cable when you go on the road, although you do need to remember a microUSB cable, the kind that charges Kindles, Bluetooth headsets, and many other electronics.  The camera cut-away is both deep for protection and angled away for unobstructed shots.  The speakers have open slots.  If you have earphones/headphones that use  a right-angle connection, then you can use the included adapter.A small design issue is the on/off button.  I like to have my battery case charged but not charging my phone so that I can use it in case of emergency.  To do this, I have to insert the phone -- it starts charging automatically -- and then hold down the silver button in the back for several seconds until the iPhone indicates that it is no longer being charged.  (The light also goes off in the back.)  I'd rather have an on/off switch the way my old Mophie cases had so that I can be sure that I'm not depleting the battery.Once I start using data-hungry apps (anything set to push or to retrieve lots of data), my iPhone 5 battery depletes itself in less than a day.

And, it is a battery you don't even notice is there, nestled on the backside of the case.When I really thought it through--after I looked at all the external battery chargers I've accumulated--I realized the combination was unbeatable.  Plus it meets Apple's performance standards.For a mere 3 ounces, with this particular uNu Power DX phone case, I get up to an entire extra charge for my phone with its 2300mAh, decent protection for the phone and a very attractive case.  This case covers all the bases, plus the manufacturers have thrown in a screen protector, too.A few extra millimeters at the bottom of the case add another worthwhile feature:  Those few mm adapt the lightning port of the iPhone 5 into a regular micro USB port .  The package comes with a quality USB cable and headphone adapter, to make things even simpler for you.New technology, optimized in the charging circuit, allows you to charge your phone at 1A / 5W speed, which doubles the charging speed of the previous  DX case.I have several external batteries that will give me 2300-2400mAh, the one with the lightest weight looks like an over-sized lipstick case and weighs 2.75 ounces.  The batteries go up in weight and size from there.  And, except for the most minimal of phone cases, for weight you can hardly beat this one that gives substantial protection.I understand the convenience of an effortless 2300mAh charge:  It allows ten EXTRA hours of talk-time, or eight hours of browsing, or seven hours of game-play, or 11 hours of video, or 42 hours of music-play.  I see 2300mAh as convenience and not as emergency power.  Personally, I feel most comfortable (as in peace-of-mind) when I have this 2300mAh backup right on my phone, a 7800-8400mAh in my desk drawer, and a 17000-20000mAh in my vehicle's console.  (With the way the weather is acting up lately, if you travel--airplane, airport, road-trip, whatever--you are crazy not to take advantage of all the external battery power you can afford.  You never know where you might get stuck without a working plug-in.)About the color and look of this case:  They call it gold.  I think it closer to a metallic champagne color.  It is matte, not shiny, so it is a very sophisticated-looking case.  Easy to hold, too.  Plus all the openings are adequate to allow access and no reflection in the camera's eye.  There is an on/off button on the back to start charging.  And there is a LED bar to gauge the amount of charge.  I especially like the way the top portion of the case slides out to allow the phone to slide in.  It seems sturdier than those cases that have a back and then a frame that snaps into place around the sides.  I think it will last longer.uNu does great with its product pages, too:  So easy to read and understand.  Very straightforward and what they claim is actually the way it is:  No gimmicks, no misrepresentation--ever, no come-ons.

A smaller top cap slips over the top of the IPhone, slides down and clicks onto the bottom case securing iPhone into case. Done.I like this design better than many of the other cases out there that have a frame that snaps around your iPhone and then snaps to the case. Those types of cases can pop apart if your phone drops onto the floor.

I will attempt to highlight the reasons why I love this case/battery combo without repeating the excellent points made of other reviewers. My tests were made with an iPhone 5S.Foremost, this manages to provide effective protection and an extended battery in a compact package. It manages to keep the thickness of your iPhone 5S to a slim 15.5mm and less than doubles the weight (the 5S weighs about four ounces on its own and this adds another three ounces.)It's the way the protection actually works that is impressive. The back is padded, the case is sufficiently raised to protect the screen face, and the clever way it snaps in place all work to protect your phone. Compared to the sibling product -uNu Aero Series iPhone 5S Battery Case- that I also tested this one offers the best protection.Of course, back-up power is another top feature. The battery pack enclosed in this case is nearly  1.5 times the capacity of the built-in battery of the iPhone 5S, which easily doubles the use time of a fully charged phone plus this case/battery combo also fully charged.The devil is in the details: I also love the cut outs that are truly precision cut and placed. This case is a perfect fit over your phone. Plus you have the added advantage of charging with a more common micro USB cable, but if you want to use the Apple Lightning cable it's a simple matter to remove the iPhone 5S from this case and charge it with the native charging cable. Unlike some cases charging cables and data syncing work with the case on with every cable I tested.Some folks hate the recessed 3.5mm phone jack and the fact that you needed an extender cable to access it. The necessary cable is provided, but since do not use the phone jack (I prefer bluetooth) I have no issues with it. If you do use your phone jack you may not care for this aspect of the design.Overall, this is a well made case/battery combo that is functional, attractive and does exactly what the manufacturer promised - a rare combination.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb design and engineering", "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2014"}

The UNU 2300mAh capacity DX charger case works great at providing a full on-board 100% recharge for the iPhone 5/5S as well as providing physical protection for the iPhone itself. And there is no loss of radio-frequency reception using it. After testing this charger case for weeks and charting the recharge time and rates, this is one of the best iPhone chargers available at this time. Adding only 3 ounces of weight and just over 1/2 inch to the length of the iPhone5, it fits comfortably in pants or shirt pockets. The DX protective case offers more protection for the back and sides of the iPhone than most cases, plus the slightly elevated case lip around the iPhone5 front area prevents the iPhone screen from directly touching a flat surface, if laid face down. A screen protector with fingerprint cutout comes with the uNu DX package and gives the iPhone all-around protection. Users can recharge the iPhone at any time to boost it back to 100% but the charging rate is very slow at higher levels.A power-depleted iPhone 5 was 'up for use' in 5 minutes at 4% charge and the iPhone reached 100% charge for at just over 2 hours when charged by the uNu Power DX case. To initiate the fully-charged DX case delivering power to the iPhone, the on/off button must be pushed for 3 seconds, there is an audible tone from the iPhone, and the blue light (for the black case) or green light (for the gold case) begins blinking for a while indicating the case has begun charging; when the case is depleted the light on the back of the case becomes a blinking red light when the on/off button is pushed. I have, as a test, charged the iPhone from the 95% level (it took about 20 minutes to get from 95% to 100%), so it takes much, much longer to charge at the higher % levels if you are trying to \"top off\" at 100%, compared to the \"1% per minute\" rate at the 0% level. When the case and iPhone are depleted of power and both are charged together, they must be connected to a power source, and then the iPhone is recharged first, followed by the DX case. The case takes about 7 and 1/2 hours to charge on its own; the IPhone takes about 2 hours. Be cautious of ITunes App Store \"battery aps\", they will tell you to stop charging when the iPhone is fully charged: \"to prevent overcharging disconnect your iPhone now\", however, the case must continue to be charged. If you are worried about overcharging the iPhone, then remove the iPhone and charge the case separately. The case will not begin charging the iPhone until you push the on/off switch. When the case is charged alone, the red light begins blinking, then turns to a blinking blue or green light, then to a steady blue or green light when fully charged.

My latest is the uNu Power DX External Protective Battery Case for iPhone 5S. I wasn't sure how much I'd like this, as I know it places more bulk and weight on my iPhone. I wondered if it would be a hassle for the backup power should I need it (it's not often that critical that I do). I'm pleasantly surprised, however... the Power DX works better than I expected, the bulk is less than I thought it would be, and there are a couple of nice side benefits with the design.The case pulls apart to allow you to drop the iPhone into the lower portion. The top portion of the case then slides over the top of the iPhone and clicks into place. The ease of removing the case was important to me for something a little further down in the review. The cutouts for the buttons and camera lens are slightly recessed due to the thickness of the case, but this acts as a nice level of protection from damage or accidental pressing while in your pocket or purse. The only cutout that is a bit problematic is the one for the headphones. The bottom cutouts are deep, and a headphone jack that is L-shaped would not fit directly into the cutout. An extension adapter is provided for those situations, but it's one more thing to keep track of. If your headphone has a straight jack, you shouldn't have a problem. For me, I rarely use headphones, so I don't much care either way.The surprise and major benefit on this design is that the charging plug is a micro-USB slot. That means you can charge AND sync your iPhone 5 with a micro-USB cord, and the need for a lightning cable is eliminated. I've tried both charging and syncing in iOS 7, and it works without a hitch. That feature alone may be reason enough to strongly consider this as your regular phone case.I mentioned earlier that I appreciated the ease of which I could remove the iPhone from the case. My bedside clock has a dock for iDevices, and I have a 30-pin to lightning adapter on it. If I choose to let the phone charge overnight, I need to remove it from the case as the micro-USB slot doesn't work for me in that situation. However, I've found that with the extra juice provided by the case, I'm only recharging every other night instead of every night.All things considered, the Power DX is a very nice case with some features that are quite useful. I even liked the gold case, as it's a subtle brushed gold look, not a shiny gaudy piece of bling. After having it on my phone for a week or so, I'm not sure I'm going to take it off any time soon.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This case offered up more benefits than I expected...", "unixReviewTime": 1395187200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2014"}

I couldn't get the little blue led light to shut off which I then realized is suppose to stay on for this particular model.Anyways back to this YP840A.  I've attempted to charge my iPad 2 from a 75% full status to see how long it would take to give it a full charge.  I didn't time it properly but it did take about 75 minutes for me to return to see it fully charge.  So I assume that it was working well.  I think attempted to charge my Samsung Note 2 which was at about 43% full status to see how long it took.  So far, it's been about 1 hour and it's at 96% and still charging.  The YP840A looks to be 2/3 full so far.  It's been doing a great job at the moment and I bet if I attempted to charge another two items it can do it.(30 minutes later)After messed around, I just wanted to see if I can charge two phones at the same time.

Most of the chargers I own have two plugs, one for smaller items and one for more major ones. But with this charger, you can charge two items at once, either two larger items requiring more power (like the iPad), or two cell phones, or any combination.It comes with a USB cord and multiple tips. While you can use your USB port to charge it, I chose to plug it into a USB charger that I already owned. Once the power crisis was over, I ran down my iPad and it charged it nicely. It maintained the charge in my iPad so that I was able to use it not just to charge the iPad, but also as a back-up battery.It is a high gloss black, and I was very grateful that it had blinking lights that showed when it was charging then showed how much charge remained in the battery.This was sent to my by Yubi as a complimentary sample so that I could test and use it for a review.

Yubi Power YP840A performed better than any of the power banks I tested so far. The best performance before Yubi YP840A was PowerGen PGMPP12000, which charged my Android phone 5% in 10 minutes. As you will see in the table below Yubi did better.Description of my tests:-------------------------I test each devices by charging each unit for 10 minutes and noting how the charge % change.  In order to provide unbiased and clear results I ran 15 different tests, each test is represented by a line in the table below.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone-----------------------------------Port1__________Yubi cable________AC source_____7% charge in 10 minutesPort2__________Yubi cable________AC source_____8% charge in 10 minutesNexus 7 Tablet-----------------------------------Port1__________Yubi cable________AC source_____4% charge in 10 minutesPort2__________Yubi cable________AC source_____3% charge in 10 minutesNexus 7 Tablet and Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone at the same time-----------------------------------Port1__________Yubi cable________AC source_____7% charge in 10 minutes (phone)Port2__________Yubi cable________AC source_____3% charge in 10 minutes (tablet)Port1__________Yubi cable________AC source_____4% charge in 10 minutes (tablet)Port2__________Yubi cable________AC source_____8% charge in 10 minutes (phone)Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7-----------------------------------Port1__________Yubi cable________AC source_____3% charge in 10 minutesPort2__________Yubi cable________AC source_____3% charge in 10 minutesPort1__________Samsung cable_____discharging___0% charge in 10 minutesPort2__________Samsung cable_____discharging___0% charge in 10 minutesDisconnected_____________________discharging___2% discharge in 10 minutesSanDisk Sansa Clip+ MP3 Player-----------------------------------Port1 - workedPort2 - workedThe MP3 player recognized the charger on both outlet, however it behaved differently than charging from the charger it came with the player itself. When I charge Sansa MP3 with a standard AC charger, the MP3 player goes into charging mode, displaying the charging animated icon. When it was plugged into the PowerGen external battery it continued to play the content. I listen to books on my MP3 player so this caused me to move forward in my book and I had to manually reset my position by a few chapters to get back to where I was when I started charging. The positive side of this, is that is possible to continue listening while MP3 is recharging. This is very handy for Sansa MP3 player since it has built-in battery that cannot be swapped for a charged one. I used to have to stop listening to have it recharged and now I can continue to listen while it re-charges. I was very happy to have this feature during hurricane Sandy when I lost power and my books on MP3 player were my only source of entertainment.Notes:1. The manufacture is offering a free connector tip for Samsung Galaxy Tablets. This connector is not available as part of the standard package, but is made available to Galaxy owners free of charge per request (documentation includes a note about a free P1000 connector for Galaxy). I tested my Galaxy 7.7 Tab with this connector and it worked very well. With my Samsung charging cable the unit was only able to slow down discharging, not recharge. The retail package includes a 30 pin Apple connector which looks very similar to P1000 Galaxy connector but does not fit the Galaxy port. I am attaching a collage of several photos (which can be located by following 'customer photo' link under the main photo). Photo #2 and Photo#3 show these two connectors next to each and show the subtle difference between the two.2. After using the micro adapter tip successfully on 7 tests (total of 70 minutes of use) the micro adapter tip stopped working. I isolated the problem to the tip by tested the cable with another micro adapter tip (that combination worked) and then this tip with another working cable (that combination did not work). I contacted the manufactor to find if there is a policy for handling bad adaptors and he said that customers who encountered this problem should contact the manufacture for a free replacement. The product comes with 1 year warranty. Another option is to replace the multi part charging cable with a single piece generic charging cable.Difference between a power cable and a data cable:Charging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see them as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source. Both my generic cable and PowerGen cables used in my tests are charging cables.3. The unit is nice looking black brick, its size is 4\" x 2.5\" x 3/4\". Its weight is 7.3 oz.4. The box contains 4 adaptor tips: micro USB, mini USB, Nokia 2mm round, and 30pin Apple. 30 pin Galaxy adaptor as avaible free upon request. The box also contains one 7\" USB cord. You can see the entire content of the package in Photo #1.5. Yubi power bank has two USB ports. They are not labelled. Documentation states that you can change devices requiring 2.1A and 1A from both outputs. Both ports behaved the same in my tests.6. Some power banks included LED flash light as part of the unit. Yubi YP840A does NOT.7. The blue lights on top of the battery pack indicate the level of power in the battery: 3 lights indicate full charge, 2 lights indicate 2/3 of full power and so forth. To turn on the device you need to press the button on top of the unit. The device can be turned off by pressing the button on the top of the unit again.8. The Warranty period for Yubi YP840A is 1 year (as stated in Amazon product description). The manual I received stated that the warranty period is 6 months. I contacted the manufacture to clarify which number is valid, and I was told that 1 year is correct and the newer versions of the manual will have this information corrected.Yubi YP840A showed the fastest re-charging of all the power bank I have tested to date. But the adapter tip died prematurely. I debated whether I should deduct a star for this defect. All power banks use these tips so they can work with multiple devices. The adapter tips are the weak points of this design and I think failures will happen in some random number of devices. I decided that based on 1 year free warranty replacement policy, the overall excellent performance of the unit, and availability of the Galaxy adapter tip (which none of the other power banks I tested offered) this unit deserves a 5 star rating.I received a sample unit for testing and writing an unbiased and honest review. I described the positives and negatives of my experience with the unit. If you have questions about my tests or features I have not addressed, I am happy to answer comments.Ali Julia review", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tested with Nexus 7 Tab, Galaxy Nexus Phone, Galaxy 7.7 Tab and Sansa Clip+ MP3", "unixReviewTime": 1359244800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2013"}

I would like to thank Yubi Power for sending me a sample to evaluate - they did so on the understanding that I would give my honest and unbiased feedback.There are several reviews up already that do a fantastic job of documenting the performance of this charger, and I highly recommend giving them a read. Not that I don't have my own thoughts to add, but I tend to look at the design and functionality of these power packs. The YP840 is a highly portable device. It's not as portable as the 520 slim model, but still can easily be slipped into a jacket pocket or laptop bag without taking up too much space or adding too much weight (MAYBE jeans, depending on how loose you wear them). Another positive feature is that it uses a standard micro USB cable for charging the power bank itself, meaning no extra proprietary cables to lug around (I already have too many for that)!There are a few design-related things that I wanted to talk about. The first is the really subtle LED system that lets you know that the device is on, charging, and what sort of charge is left. On many of the battery packs I have tried, the LEDs were WAY too bright (a pet peeve of mine), meaning that when being used on a night-stand they had to be turned over so as not to light up the room - not a huge sacrifice, but an inconvenient one nonetheless. Not so with the YP840 - the blue LEDs are subtle yet informative. Unlike the slim version, there is no LED flashlight built in. No points taken off, but it's a feature of the 520 that I enjoy. The dual-USB ports are highly convenient, allowing for two devices to be charged at any one time.Some general thoughts. The battery pack itself is very well made, using a durable and hard plastic. Despite being relatively light for a pack of its capacity, it seems like it will take a drop or two without breaking, something I definitely value in a product. A single push on the power button will turn the device on, pressing and holding will turn the device completely off. It charges very well - I am able too charge my iPhone 4 four to five times without fully depleting the charger's battery, as expected from the product description. Charging the pack itself takes around 10 hours, which is to be expected, and something that you just have to force yourself to remember to do! The charger comes with an Apple connector (30 pin), something that sets it apart from many other chargers.Overall I am very pleased with the YP840 - it is indispensable, well-made, and the footprint is something that as I mentioned, puts it in the \"every day carry\" category that is hard to reach in my personal collection of electronic devices.

It feels very solid, with a nicely molded case, rounded corners, and good quality input jacks. While build quality is not always an indicator of good engineering and performance, it's usually a good sign that care and thought went into the manufacturing process.The device is larger than I expected. It's about 2.5 by 3.75 inches, and weighs a hefty 7.4 ounces. Definitely something I'd carry in my briefcase rather than my pocket.(As an aside, I was also quite pleased with being able to unbox it without having to use any cutters. Two big thumbs up for not using that horrible clamshell packaging! It comes in a box with a plastic carrier that opens easily without any tools.)The overall concept of these devices is pretty straightforward. They contain one (or more) litium cells which take and store a charge. You can then use the stored charge to recharge a phone, tablet, etc. - pretty much anything that has modest power needs (e.g., you can't use it to recharge a full size laptop, for example).There's a series of indicator lights to let you know the charge level. Very useful not only to gague how much power you have left, but also to determine when it has been fully charged (via a wall outlet or USB port. Note that an AC adapter is not included).It has 2 USB outputs to allow it to charge 2 devices at the same time.Operation is very simple. Just plug and go (or rather, plug and wait for the device to receive a charge). I used it on a Kindle Fire to bring it from 10% to full charge, and had more than enough power left over in the Power Bank to recharge a Samsung phone. It took about 80 minutes to charge the Kindle; about 40 minutes for the phone. There was enough capacity left to top off the charge on a eGo 1100mAh mod (left it hooked up to the charger for 30 min, but unsure of the amount of charge that was put in since the eGo does not have a battery level indicator).It's a great device to carry along in the car or your briefcase for those times when your battery is running on empty and there's no easy way to plug into an outlet.

Many times I've been in an airport looking for an outlet to charge up, but other people have tethered themselves to all the available ones.  This is where an external battery comes in handy.  This Yubi Power Bank is solid, sleek, and has the added benefit of being able to charge two USB devices at the same time.All external batteries have a power attrition rate that is much less than the stated capacity of the battery.  Most brands are about 67-70% efficient when converting the internal charge to an external device.  The material that comes with this Power Bank claims a 8400mAh capacity with an efficiency of \"more than 88%.\"  If this refers to the power conversion efficiency, it would mean that the battery should supply at least 7392 mAh of power.  My iPad has a 11,666 mAh battery, which means I should expect the battery to be charged 63% when depleting this battery.  Instead, the best I got (with the iPad turned off to eliminate the possibility of usage during charging) was a 53% charge after six charges/discharges.  (It took five cycles for the battery to reach its maximum charge, with a 2% charge gain for each of the previous four charges.) This indicates a 73% maximum power conversion efficiency.  While this efficiency is certainly better than many, if not most, of its competitors, buyers should not expect a full 88% from the Power Bank.  Of course, it beats being stuck somewhere without power, and the battery still holds a decent amount of power.  You should get four full iPhone 5 charges out of one battery cycle.One downside to this battery is the length of the supplied charging cable.  It's about six inches long, which means that I cannot use my own USB wall charger because the power pack would still be dangling in the air.  Given the weight, it would disconnect.  If I use the supplied cable, I'm limited to using the USB port on my iMac to charge it or to plugging it into a floor power pack/surge protector.  When I'm in a hotel, however, neither of these options are available to me.  A 10\" cable would be much better.  I also would have liked a travel pouch like the one Anker provides with their batteries to keep everything together, although, that's a minor wish.The Power Bank a nice external battery that allows me to charge both my husband's and my iPhones at the same time.

I've had one portable battery before and do have theYubi 8400 mAh High Capacity Portable Battery.  If you really need some power you might want to consider this Power Bank as it's a real power horse that I'm using with my biggest power hog, the iPad.  It will also charge a couple of devices simultaneously.The 5200 mAh Yubi is no slouch in the power department, but I'm using it primarily for items that don't draw or demand massive amounts of power.  Think Smartphones, Kindles, your GPS, or iPhone.  This Yubi is perfect to leave at work or take with you when you are heading to the library, a bookstore, or anywhere else where you'll need it and don't have access to a plug.  Those critters are out there, but I never manage to be the first one on the scene and once someone is using a plug in a Wi-Fi accessible area, they're reluctant to give them up.Portable devices aren't any good if you can't charge them up and this Yubi is perfect.  It's not only portable, but quite compact.  The LED flashlight is a total bonus, especially if you need a bit of light when you're heading to your car or trying to spot something when the lights go out.  Little touches such as this one are always appreciated.  I do like the accessories, but generally use the ones provided with any particular device I'm using.  The Yubi is high-performance and charged up my Kindle and Kindle Fire as quickly and readily as if I'd plugged it into an outlet in my house.

They have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house.  If you are like us, you probably always have something that is low on batteries at all times.  A typical scenario in our house is someone piling the kids in the car to go to the store, or the mall, or out to eat or wherever and grabbing the iPad or iPods, only to find them dead.  Noooooooooooooo!  These are the only things that keep us sane!  So that is where a portable charging solution would be great.I was provided a Yubi Power YP840A 8400mAh Power Bank for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.Initial Impression:  The product looks nice.  It comes in a smooth black finish that is made of plastic.  It looks and feels very solid in your hand.  It has one power button, four blue LEDs, a micro USB input for charging the Power Bank and a two normal USB Outputs for charging your electronics.  It is about size of a deck of cards and the thickness of a little less than two.  It is fairly heavy which is expected since it is high capacity battery pack.  It is very compact and sleek looking.  It also came with a cool USB cord with four interchangeable tips (Apple 30-pin, Micro USB, Mini USB and a PSP Tip).  Three of the lights represent the capacity gauge which tells you an approximation of how much power the unit has remaining.It came with some charge to it so I plugged it into my computer and charged it overnight to fill it up.  The three blue LEDs that were next to each other stopped blinking and stayed on indicating that the Power Bank was full the next morning.  After it was full I did some testing.Test #1:  Took the fully charged Power Bank and plugged in my mostly depleted iPhone 5 that had only 20% charge remaining.  I checked it every 10 minutes or so and got the following readings.Starting Point = 20% ChargeAfter 10 Minutes = 31% ChargeAfter 30 Minutes = 53% ChargeAfter 60 Minutes = 84% ChargeAfter 90 Minutes = Full ChargeOverall, great results.  It was averaging about 1% per minute which seems pretty good and equivalent to other Power Banks I have tested.  The Power Bank easily charged a pretty low iPhone 5 without any problem and the indicator lights showed that it still had plenty of juice for at least another couple of charges.Test #2:  I plugged in the Power Bank into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in the morning and ready to go.  I took my 2nd Gen iPad that had about 14% battery left and started charging it.  The battery in my iPad is still extremely strong even though it is a little older.  It took me forever to run the thing down using full brightness and a video playing for several hours.  I checked it fairly often and got the following readings.Starting Point = 14% ChargeAfter 1 Hour = 35% ChargeAfter 2 Hours 45 Minutes = 53% ChargeAfter 3 Hours 30 Minutes = 65% ChargeAfter 4 Hours 48 Minutes = 83% ChargeAfter 5 Hours 30 Minutes = 90% Charge and the Power Bank was emptyThis was a long test and the Power Bank performed very well.  It was able to increase the charge by 76% before it ran out of juice.  Capacity wise, this Power Bank should be able to fill up an iPad 2, but my tests are not exactly scientific.  I had to download a stopwatch program to use on the iPad to keep the time since there is no iOS clock app, so this running app may have used up some power while it was charging.  Overall, I am very pleased with the result and the speed did not seem any longer than plugging it into the wall.Test #3:  We took our two discharged 3rd Gen iPod Touches (one for each daughter so they don't fight over them) and threw them in my Wife's purse with the Power Bank and checked it when we got to our destination where we would need the iPods to keep them occupied.  With the two USB Outputs, we were able to charge them both at the same time.  It had increased the battery levels to around 65% and 59% in about 25 minutes which gave us enough power get through this trip.  It charged them both very quickly and the Power Bank gave off very little heat if any in the purse.  I can see this scenario happening all the time.Conclusion:  Overall, the Yubi Power YP840A 8400mAh Power Bank worked very during my initial tests and usage.  The product is compact and easy to use.  It looks and feels very solid.  The current price of $40 seems very competitive with the other Power Banks of this size that are available on Amazon, and is significantly less expensive in some cases.  I can see this as an excellent option for longer travel use such as a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug.  I like this unit and will probably get a lot of use out of it with some work trips coming up in the near future.

The Yubi Power YP840A power bank is great for maximizing power storage in a small size.  The device offers a great amount of power for the price.What makes it so great:+Lightweight- For the capacity, this unit weighs less than 7 oz (195g), great for tossing in any day bag or purse.+Sleek operation- This unit is very responsive, a press to turn the unit on for charging devices and a press to turn it off when finished, easy to use and understand.+Dual USB charging ports- For the gadget guru, sometimes you just need to charger multiple devices at one time, this is a great feature, and for the day out with a friend, you may save the day being able to charger their phone and yours without the need for an outlet.+Recharges with a Micro-USB cable- This is a big plus.  When traveling I try to bring only the necessary charging cables; no longer will I need to carry a specialty cable/charger to recharge my power bank, I can use the same cable I use for my Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HD to recharge this unit, fantastic.Having a very on the go life, I like to have options when recharging my phone, tablet, and digital camera; this is perfect for that purpose. The capacity of this power bank will allow you to charge a Kindle Fire or Nexus 7 to full charge and have additional charge left.  This power bank can also provide multiple charges to your cell phone on a single charge.What you should consider when deciding to purchase any power bank is the mAh the unit can hold, essentially, how much of a charge it can hold total and provide to devices being charged. This unit has a 8,400 mAh capacity. Other reviewers have proffered thoughtful reviews about which devices have what mAh battery, so I won't rehash all that. Consider this unit as great for use with cellphones providing multiple charges, and most tablets providing close to 1.5 charges (for a typical 4400mAh battery (Kindle Fire/Nexus7) or over 50% charge for larger iPads. The Yubi Power YP840A will add hours of life to your iPad, though it does not have the capacity for a full charge.Overall, this unit is perfect for charging just about any device on the go. This is not a burst of power, this device adds hours of life to your devices when getting to an outlet is just not workable. The Yubi Power YP840A is priced right and lives up to its promises.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

Three lights indicate more than 80% power remains, two lights mean 30-80% and one light means less than 30% power remains. I wish there were actually four light indicators but three will do.The unit has a solid feel. I used it to charge a 30% battery level Droid Incredible 4G, which took about 80 minutes to charge fully. I also used it to take a 17% Kindle Fire to full battery power in just over an hour. It sill had two out of three charge lights available. I then charged an iPod classic with about 50% power left and that was about the time it needed recharging.I was impressed with how quickly it charged these devices.If you've ever run out somewhere and forgot to fully charge a device, you know how convenient it is to have something like this in your briefcase. If you have ever been caught in a power outage, you know how frustrating it is to get to a power source to charge what is probably your only form of communication for awhile.It would have been nice to have a carry bag or pouch to contain the unit, cable and tips but it's easy enough to find something in my closet.I was provided a unit for testing and evaluation.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Packed with Power, Charged Devices Quickly", "unixReviewTime": 1359331200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2013"}

And they could be used concurrently (very nice).&#10004; COMES WITH A BAG: this is very important to me. You are not going to take everything with you but the nice black bag can easily hold the iFLASH, the wall charger and the few wires and plugs you may need for your devices.&#10004; CHARGE INDICATOR RINGLIGHTS: they light up when you press a button and 4 blue rings mean 100% full, 3 rings mean 75% full and so forth.&#10004; LITTLE LED FLASHLIGHT: just in case.

If offers 2 USB output ports (0.6A and 2.0A) an integrated LED flashlight and a charge level \"gas gauge.\" It offers a total of 8,400mAh capacity.What sets it apart from other power banks is its style - it is very nice looking! It's a high gloss black with a white accent strip on the side. The corners and sides are rounded, so it feel nice to carry and slips easily into a pocket. The charge level indicator consists of 4 blue circles on the front. It's probably the best-looking charge level indicator I've seen so far.The size is reasonable for its capacity - it weighs 6.5 ounces, and measures roughly 4 inches long by 2.5 inches wide. It's somewhat thick (3/4 inch).The build quality is good -- very solid feeling. The base is flat so it will stand up on edge securely. The two USB output ports are firmly attached with no wiggling even when I stressed the attached cables. The micro USB input for charging is also securely fastened.It comes with the usual variety of adapters and connectors so it can be used with pretty much everything. It also includes a wall adapter plug and a decent carry pouch.It does not have an auto-on feature. You have to push the power on button when you want the attached device to start charging.Given that the output is limited to 2A, this is not a good choice for tablet charging. But, given the 8,400mAh capacity, it really is more geared to phone and small device use rather than tablet charging. So, I won't hold that against it. Note that while the product listing states \"2.6A output\" that referrs to the combined total output -- one 2A outlet and 1 0.6A outlet. The max it can put out to a connected device is 2A.What I will hold against it is, ironically, related to one of it's major pluses - appearance. While the glossy black looks great, it's also a major fingerprint magnet. And I mean major! While the gloss looks great when it's clean, it's not nearly as good looking when it's all smudged up (which happens quickly). A matte finish would have been a better option.I'll nick this a half-star for the fingerprint attraction feature, but will round the overall rating up to 5 stars since it does everything else very well. Well worth considering if you're looking for a decent capacity power bank for phone use that is well-built and looks nice. It's not the one to get, however, if you have a major problem with fingerprint smudges.[sample provided for review]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stylish power bank for phones", "unixReviewTime": 1373760000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2013"}

It has two output USB ports and a micro USB input port.  The LED flashlight, activated by double clicking on the power button, is slightly more powerful than most found in power banks, so it becomes a useful tool rather than a head-scratching addition.  The amount of power remaining is displayed by four blue LED circles.I've learned a lot about power banks over the past couple of years, and one important consideration for those new to buying one is the power transfer attrition -- that is, the amount of power lost when transferring a charge from the battery to a device.  You cannot simply do the math to determine how much power you will get.  For instance, if you took the capacity of the 3rd generation iPad battery and divided it by 8400, you might expect a 73% charge from this power bank.  The reality is quite different -- and not unexpectedly so.  I get approximately a 50% charge on my 3rd generation iPad from this iFlash battery, about average for a power bank.  Expect a 30% attrition rate from this battery.The two output USB ports are 2.0 amps and .6 amps, the first necessary for more power hungry devices like the iPad.  The .6 amp output port will charge my iPhone 5 (lightning cable not included), allowing me to charge both devices at once, although I have been unable to tell whether the battery gives priority to one port or the other.  The construction feel solid and looks sleek.The black version (it also comes in white) has a glossy black case with a white stripe running across three sides.  As with many black glossy electronics, it is a fingerprint magnet.  I like the white stripe, however, even though it detracts a little from the aesthetics:  I can locate it easier inside my briefcase than I can an all-black battery.  It comes with a selection of adapters, two charging cables, a vinyl storage pouch, and (yes!) an AC wall charger.If you are looking for a battery that can charge a smartphone several times -- about 5 charges for my iPhone 5 -- or that can give a boost to your tablet, then this is a solid option.

It's a small, sleek unit and could easily be carried in a purse, knapsack, or briefcase. The top of the battery pack has the four LED indicators.  Beneath that on the front side is the small LED flashlight, and two output ports (2A and 0.6A).  FYI, that small LED flashlight can be run continuously \"as long as 380 hours at full power status.\"  It's small, but would be great in emergency situations.

At 3.7\"x2.5\"x0.8\" and weighing 6.7 ounces, it compares very favorably in size and weight to other chargers with similar capacities. It's small enough to carry in a pocket, and the smoothly curved edges won't poke a hole in your pocket or book bag. It's also built solidly enough to withstand the bouncing around and other abuse that these devices are subjected to in a glove compartment, book bag, or briefcase. The five plugs (including two micro-USB plugs) included in the package will work with almost every mobile device currently sold in the US, including iOS/Apple devices.The AC wall adapter is the smallest that I've ever seen, just a 1\" cube with a plug, but it works fine with no overheating. One of the two charging ports provides up to 2.0 Amps, while the other port provides 0.6 Amp. Each port is marked with the correct output. Generally, the 2.0A port is intended for tablets, and the 0.6A port is intended for cell phones. Most devices, however, can be safely recharged from either port. To test the charger, I used two cellphones (iPhone 4 and Samsung Stratosphere), two tablets (Kindle Fire HD 7\" and Nexus 7), and a Kindle Paperwhite ebook reader. I tried each device in each charging port, and they all were recharging with no problems. (I had previously tested our devices in other chargers, and all of them would safely charge at 2.0 Amps with no overheating or other issues).Allowing for some electrical losses, the iFlash 8400mAh charger has enough capacity to recharge most cellphones (typical batteries have 1400-2000mAh) 4-5 times, and small tablets (typical batteries have 4000-5000mAh) at least once; with larger tablets, you would get one full recharge, or at least extend the runtime by several hours.Two nice touches that I really liked: 1) a built-in LED flashlight, and 2) the charger automatically turns itself off a few seconds after disconnecting it from a mobile device. Also, the charging kit includes a pouch to store everything in.Overall, the iFlash Mobile 8400 charger is an excellent choice for any user of mobile devices who needs a high-capacity recharger when they're on the go.Note: The iFlash 8400 is also available with white trim:iFlash Dual USB 8400mah External Battery Charger Source with 2.6A Output (fast) Heavy Duty Ouput Support iPad 1 / 2 / 3 / 4, iPad Mini, iPhone 5 / 4S / 4, Google Android Phones, HTC EVO, LG, Samsung Galaxy S II III Note II, BlackBerry Moblie Phones - WhiA product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A complete kit for recharging mobile devices", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2013"}

To test their performance I run the same set on tests on each of them in order to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.To test Intocircuit power pack I ran my 10 minute test for each of my 3 devices on each of the 2 ports for a total of 6 tests. In addition I charged both Nexus phone and Nexus Tablet at the same time, one in each port. The results of these 7 tests are included in the tables below.I am attaching a collage of 2 photos.

The size of the power pack is 2.625\" by 4.375\" by 0.875\".Photo #2 shows the top of the unit which has an LED screen showing the level of charge. Next to the screen there is a small lack button which turns on the LED light. The light is pretty dim. Some other power bricks I have have a much brighter light, however this is not a key feature of the battery pack and the underpowered light did not effect my rating of this unit.This power pack has two outlets, they are not labelled.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.The key findings:(1) Both Nexus phone and Nexus 7 tablet (both running Jelly Bean 4.21) charged at AC rate on both ports.(2) Samsung Galaxy 7.7 works, but shows different behaviors on the two portsThe table below summarizes my findings:Nexus 7 Tablet--------------right port.......AC rate.....1% charge increaseleft port........AC rate.....2% charge increaseSamsung Galaxy Nexus Phone--------------------------right port.......AC rate.....5% charge increase (among the best rates in my tests)left port........AC rate.....5% charge increase (among the best rates in my tests)Nexus 7 Tablet and Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone at the same time--------------------------------------------------------------Tablet...........AC rate.....1% charge increasePhone............AC rate.....5% charge increase (among the best rates in my tests)Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7--------------------------right port.......AC rate..... 1% charge increaseleft port........AC rate..... discharging if screen is on, 1% charge increase if screen is offIn addition to the tests above we used Nexus 7 Tablet to navigate during a several hour trip while plugged into Intocircuit Power Castle Series PC11200 11200mAh external battery (rather than the car charger).

So when I was packing for a 10 day family vacation last month, I found myself trying to decide what power bank to take along and how many I might need. Just days before my trip, I received this pack in the fun blue color, and after one look at the attachments that came with it, decided on taking it for myself to use.It's a good sized battery, with a little bit of weight to it. It's just a tiny bit larger than a deck of cards, and about 25% thicker. The brushed metal blue case really makes it stand out, when comparing it to most other batteries that are designed with basic black cases. On the front of the battery there is a LCD screen with an on/off button. You can turn this pack on and off to see just how much battery life you still have for charging your devices. When turned on, the LCD screen then lights up with a bright blue LED light backing, so you can see the display even in the dark.On the end of this power bank there are two USB ports available for charging your devices, and a single mini-USB port for recharging this pack. I used this battery pack constantly on my 10 day trip, for charging both my iPad mini and my iPhone. This battery pack held a lot of power, and I was able to recharge my devices again and again on a single charge of this pack. I can recall recharging this battery pack only once during the whole trip. We spent most of our vacation on a beach, and I plugged my iPhone into this battery pack every day so that my phone would hold a charge while I used it for listening to music, browsing the web and checking emails. On a few occasions I also used this battery pack to recharge my Samsung digital camera and my little Kodak video recorder.Besides it's bright blue color, large size and ability to hold a good amount of charge, it also comes with a pack full of very handy charging cables/adapters. Even one for Apple devices! Many battery packs have charging cables included with them when you buy them, but most still don't include an Apple adapters. I love that this Intocircuit battery pack did. With the cable and adapter tips that came with this pack, I was able to charge all my Samsung, Kodak and Apple devices without the need to bring all their own individual charges along. In addition, I thought I would note that I had no problem with the TSA taking issue with this battery pack when I was flying. I was flagged when going through the body scan machine at security (metal rivets on my jeans landed me a lower body pat-down and my luggage being searched) and they went through all my stuff.

At 10,000mAh it has plenty of power to charge both smartphones and tablets.Here are my general guidelines for selecting the size of a external battery pack- Less than 6000mAh - smaller in size and work well for smartphones - can be used on tablets in a pinch- 6000mAh to 10,000mAh - a nice blend of size and storage capacity - ideal for people who will use their external battery pack for both smartphones and tablets- Above 10,000mAh - Larger in size - probably too big and bulky to be used as a primary battery pack for smartphones, but they have enough power capacity to provide significant charge to a tablet.Notes- Features 2 USB output s- one at 5V at 1A which is ideal for smartphones, and a 5V 2Amp output which works well with tablets.- Comes with 5 tips for charging - the mini-USB which is connected to the cable, but it also includes for adapter tips - a 30-pin adapter, a micro USB, and two more connectors.- Provides 10,000mAh of capacity - which is enough to charge an iPhone almost 4 times and provides about 100% of a charge to a tablet.- Comes with a  very nice velvet case. The case includes a pouch that can hold all of your attachments and cables.- A little bit longer than the size of an iPhone- LED changes colors to indicate how much power remains in the battery packFinal verdict - The IntoCircuit 10,000mAh is a powerful external battery pack.

{"reviewerID": "A25C2M3QF9G7OQ", "asin": "B00BB5GQRE", "reviewerName": "Comdet", "helpful": [59, 64], "reviewText": "Power banks are becoming pretty common these days and basically all work the same: they house one or more lithium batteries which you charge via AC current, then use the power bank to charge a portable devoice, such as a phone, tablet, etc.Since the overall operation is so similar, power banks distinguish themselves mainly on design and ease-of-use features. In these regards, the Intocircuit does a very nice job.The power bank offers 11,200mAh of power which gives it enough capacity to cover a few charges of a small device (such as a phone) or one charge of a larger device (such as a tablet). In my case, I use it mainly to keep my Kindle Fire 8.9 charged, and it does a capable job - for example, it brought it from 30% to 80% charge while still retaining enough capacity to recharge my Samsung phone from nearly empty to full.But, pretty much any power bank of a similar mAh rating could do the above tasks. What I like about this one is the overall design - it looks nice! The case (I have the gray one) is metal with a brushed finish. The end-caps are plastic, but have a softness to them. The overall affect is that it feels and looks nice, rather than cheap and \"plasticy.\"It's more compact than other power banks I've used in this power range. It measures about 4.5 inches tall and 2.75 inches wide. It's pretty thick - just shy of 1 inch thick. It also has some heft, weighing in a 9.9 ounces. Unfortunately, size and weight are the prices paid for more capacity, but this power bank does a good job of keeping things manageable.All the ports are at one end. It offers two outputs (1 is 2.1A; the other is 1.0A rated), an 5v in connection and a LED flashlight. The ports are well-attached with no wiggling or give even when I put a lot of stress on the cables. On the front is a decent-size, clear screen that shows a battery icon with the charge level. It also indicates which ports are in use. There's an on/off button, but it's not necessary to turn it on to use - it has an auto-on feature that engages the charging as soon as the cables are attached.You can use the on button for the flashlight (press it twice rapidly to turn on the flashlight). It's a nice touch since I'm often using this in a car and an extra light to see the ports is helpful. It puts out a decent amount of light - more than enough to see where what goes where when inserting cables.The power bank comes with an assortment of the usual attachments to cover a range of devices. I won't list them here since they are in the product listing. I only used the micro USB cable (which worked just fine and felt decently made), so I can't speak to how well the other attachments work.It also comes with a soft pouch that is large enough to hold the power bank plus a few attachments. I was especially pleased to see that it comes with an AC adaptor - other power banks I've used skip that. The adapter is compact and fits easily in the pouch. The amp rating for the adapter is not listed on the adapter nor in the specs.There are some misses:1. The lettering for the port power output (1.0 or 2.1 amp) is black on black and VERY hard to see unless there's bright light. I stuck an adhesive dot next to the 2.1 port so I could easily spot it.2. The on/off button is very small and feels cheap, unlike the rest of the power bank. While it is not needed much since this is an auto-on devoice, a larger button with a better \"click\" feel would have been nice.3. The screen is clear but the screen cover is thin and flexes. Again, it introduces a somewhat cheap feel to an otherwise solid device. The screen is also a fingerprint magnet (unlike the case, which is fingerprint-proof due to the brushed finish).4. No power rating for the AC adapter.I'll keep the rating at 5 stars since these misses 1-3 are mostly cosmetic; miss #4 is more of my curiosity than an essential issue. It's a decent power bank that is worth considering.[Manufacturer provided sample for review]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An attractive, nicely-designed power bank", "unixReviewTime": 1365206400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2013"}

The top is glossy piano black, while the underside sports a high polish chrome. Mixing of the plastic top and metal bottom gives it a nice balance. In the hand it has a very nice solid feel, the groves on the bottom stops it from sliding around. For a \"Real World Sizing\", it is similar to the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Having two USB ports, allows the flexibility to charge multiple devices. The smaller port is rated at 5V/1A, which is perfect for smartphones or other smaller mobile devices. The bigger port is rated at 5V/2A, this is mainly for tables or larger devices. The layout is very nice, the charging port is in the middle with the USB ports on either side. The design is even better, many hours of planning has gone into this device. The size issue might be draws back for some, but the lightness of battery will even the score.

When you&#8217;re looking to power up a smartphone or other small device, usually you&#8217;ll want to be around the 3500 to 7000mAh range.  If you need power, the 10000 is usually the starting range you&#8217;ll want to take a look at.I always test my battery packs rather informally using a first generation iPad.  My tests may be informal, but they are also very telling.  The Intocircuit was an incredible performer.  What I look at specifically is how much it charges in the first fifteen minutes and take a general look at it over a short period of time.Yes, it did well in the first fifteen minutes and didn&#8217;t drop a lot of charge during its initial push.  I&#8217;ve had some very nice, supposedly awesome name brands that have lost out during the first fifteen minutes.  The Intocircuit just kept moving right along until my iPad was fully charged.  This was quite an unexpected performance.I&#8217;m not quite sure what my expectations were, but I know what they weren&#8217;t ... I didn&#8217;t expect a full charge from such a depleted iPad.  Every time I checked the Intocircuit continued its charge.  It was doing much better than expected and by the time the iPad was fully charged, I&#8217;m sure I had enough juice left for my Kindle.

The choice will ultimately come down to your needs. If you spend most of your time near a wall outlet, then your standard wall charger will be all that you will almost ever need. If you spend a lot of time traveling, especially via a plane, and you tend to carry a lot of gadgets with you, then I would recommend you look into getting at least a 10,000 mAh external battery. For everything in between you can select the battery size closest to your needs and the kind of gadgets you carry around. I would not recommend going below a 5,000 mAh battery though. The smaller batteries will probably not be sufficiently big for a full recharge if you don't remember to charge them up regularly.This is a very nice, effective, and compact battery. It is slightly larger than iPhone 5/5S and similar to it in its overall shape. It can be easily carried around in a small messenger bag, briefcase, or a purse. It can even fit in a pocket (hey, it is the size of a phone), but I would personally not recommend it.The battery doesn't come with its own charging adapter, which is not such a big deal for me: I have plenty of USB charging adapters laying around. The battery has two charging ports and comes with a micro USB cable. It also features a small micro USB to 30-pin adapter, which comes in handy with the iOS devices. However, it doesn't seem like an Apple certified adapter, so it may or may not work with all of their devices. It also doesn't feature a lightning cable adapter, which is unfortunate since that is the cable used by the majority of iOS devices out there right now.The charging time for this battery was pretty quick, as was the charging of external devices. I was able to fully charge my iPhone with plenty of room to spare. I was even able to charge my iPad to about 50% of its capacity. I also tried it with several other micro-USB charging devices (Galaxy S 3, Kindle, headphones, ...) and it worked fine with all of them, although I did not test them fully to ascertain the total charging time.I wish that this charger included a permanently attached cable (or even better - a couple of them), as well as the wall prongs to be used for direct charging from the wall without a use of an adapter. With such additions this could be a truly perfect portable charging solution. Other than that, I am very pleased with this battery and would recommend it to anyone who is in a need of small extra charging while on the go.**** Product sample provided for review purposes. ****", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent Small Power Bank", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2014"}

It's become a very competitive field with new brands and models popping up every month. The Intocircuit Power Castle 11,200mAh external battery pack is one of the newest entries in the crowded field, and based on my initial impressions, it looks like a formidable competitor. Physically, it's one of the larger (4.3\"x2.8\"x0.9\") and heavier (9.8 ounces) rechargers that I've used, but it's not out of line with other units in the 11,000-12,000 mAh capacity range. And it's very solidly made, with a brushed aluminum case protecting the insides.As I would expect with 11,200mAH capacity, the device has two charging ports - one rated at 5 volts/2.1 amp maximum and the other at 5 volts/1.0 amp maximum. Both ports are labeled, although the labels are very difficult to read because of low contrast. The battery pack is recharged with the included power adapter that plugs into a wall outlet (note: the power adapter is unlabeled, but the product guide indicated that the output is 1-2 amps). The device can also be plugged into the USB port of a PC for recharging itself. An LCD panel displays the charging status of the unit. Very conveniently, the Power Castle automatically begins charging when a mobile device is plugged in, and it turns itself off when recharging is completed or when the mobile device is unplugged. It can also be turned on and off manually with a small button located next to the LCD display. There's also a built-in LED flashlight that's operated with the same button.I tested the Power Castle unit with three devices - a Samsung smartphone, an iPhone 4, and a Kindle Fire HD 7\". I did not attempt to quantify the charging rate, but it had no problem recharging a smartphone and a tablet simultaneously. The Power Castle unit includes a set of adapter plugs that should fit almost all mobile devices, including Apple. The kit comes with a drawstring pouch to carry everything in.Overall, I was very impressed with the Power Castle Series PC11200. It appears to be a solidly-built, rugged unit for recharging mobile devices when a lot of capacity is needed.

I found it to be a really great piece of equipment: lots of uses, very reliable, quick, and extremely easy to lug around if I want to travel--its plug even folds inward when not in use. And it's extremely lightweight.The ports are labeled asPORTS 1 & 2: UniversalPORTS 3: Universal/iPadPORTS 4: Universal/SamsungAs stated, all ports are considered to be universal, but the instructions note that ports 3 and 4 are to be used IF ports 1 and 2 do not charge specific devices. I've read in a couple of reviews that these particular ports (3 and 4) have been constructed with alterations to the D+ and D- ports (as well as a couple of \"pin\" specs), but I'm no electrical genius...please look elsewhere if you want those specifics.What I CAN tell you is that this is a great little gadget. Every device I wanted charged was done so quickly and efficiently, and this tool helped immensely there. Think of how many times someone says out of the blue that they want to head out in 20 minutes, and a glance at your phone, Kindle, iPad, whatever, tells you that it needs to be charged, and quickly. Well, this not only did that, but has the capacity to do so with four ports concurrently.  The total output is four amps.  (Be aware, though, that charging several devices simultaneously will slow down the speed of charging--which makes complete sense, but it bears being stated.)Think, too, of the convenience of having less to carry around: I throw my gizmos into a messenger-type bag when I'm heading somewhere, and it's a chore carrying around the separate chargers for my Kindle Fire, Samsung phones, and my daughter's iPad and iPhone. This is a BIG improvement. And if you are heading, say, to a motel or any other place where wall sockets are not easy to come by, this is a really helpful apparatus.Another thing I liked about the device is the beautiful iridescent blue LED glow that it has when in use...not only does it make the item easy to find, but it also signifies that you have an electrical device plugged in that you might want to check. About the only down side to this is that you might want to place a small cloth over it if you are charging something in the same room you sleep in.My only recommendations would include a better written set of directions (though very coherent, they aren't very extensive), and maybe a slightly clearer representation of ports 1 through 4 on the device itself...I'm an old fart, and it's hard for me to read the tiny print on the present device.Bolse's specification sheet states that the charger has \"Intelligent overheat, overcharging and over-current protection built in.\" Its warranty is for 12 months from date of purchase, and it covers manufacturer's defects, but note these two caveats:1. The warranty is void if the apparatus is considered to be damaged or misused; and2. You must still possess the original receipt. I'd consider keeping it and the warranty, directions, etc, inside the box and somewhere accessible.On that note, the device seems hardy and well made. I did drop it twice from the height of a wall socket--(maybe a foot or so)--and the device showed NO signs of damage.One final thing: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review (which this is).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Little Device for Charging Multiple Products Quickly", "unixReviewTime": 1381190400, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2013"}

I'm going to try not to sound like a shill in this review, but really there is only one very minor complaint that I have with this charger, everything else exceeded expectations! The charger has four outputs, each labelled for the type of device they are recommended four. All four are marked \"universal\" or \"u\", meaning all four can be used for any device, but one of the ports is marked specifically for \"iPad\" and the other for \"Samsung\". These are higher output ports that will charge devices with larger requirements more efficiently, definitely something that I look for in a multi-port product!The product is very well made overall, constructed of high-grade plastic that looks well up to the challenge of travelling.

The LED indicator on this charger is way too bright. In my office during the day, it's fine, but at night it's like a beacon of technology and lights up the ceiling. An easy fix (I have done both) is some black nail polish over the LED (I keep a bottle in my desk for this exact reason), or you can use electrical tape. It's a small thing, but manufacturers seem to be slow to catch on to the fact that some of us like to sleep in darkness...Overall this is a fantastic product that charges devices quickly, can charge multiple devices at the same time, and can be used all over the world if you have the right adapter.

It's definitely a solid, well-made charger.  I have seen a generic 10W charger that was cheaply made and it can't come close to the quality of this one.  I especially like the Flip Down AC prongs.  When they are nestled down into the unit they are flush and don't extend beyond the body of the charger.

The wall charger has four ports along the bottom of the unit.  All four are marked universal with the third port having an additional iPad marking and the fourth one having an additional Samsung marking.  The charger has folding prongs that make it easy to store and travel with.  It has a single blue light on the front that indicates that it has power when plugged in.  Overall, it looks like a well built, solid product.&#9830; Use and Performance - I tested the charger in various configurations and scenarios.  The results are as follows:Test #1 (Simultaneous Charging) - The first thing I did was plug in four different products into the charger at the same time.  I plugged in my iPhone 5, my iPad 2, my wife's cheapie slider phone and a power bank.  The charger had no problem charging all of them.  My iPhone even started doing a WiFi sync and completed with no problem.  The charger did get quite warm when charging the four devices, but when I removed all the devices and left it plugged in, it cooled off, so it only gives off heat when charging.Test #2 (Charging Speed) - While all four of the devices mentioned above were plugged in, I kept track of the charging speed of the iPad 2.  I had it plugged into the iPad specific port and it showed very impressive charging speeds.  The charge percentage increased 4% after 10 minutes and 8% after 20 minutes.  These were very impressive results and some of the fastest I have seen after testing many chargers.  The result was especially impressive because those fast speeds were achieved while still charging three other devices.Test #3 (Port Usage) - The last test I did was try out the different devices in each port to see which devices worked with which port.  The iPhone 5 charged in all four ports, as did the slider phone and the power bank.  The iPad charged in the first three ports, but was not recognized in the Samsung specific port.  Keep in mind, the iPad will charge slower in the non-iPad specific ports, but it will charge nonetheless.  The charger works with a lot of different device configurations which is very convenient.Conclusion:Overall, the Bolse 4 Port USB Wall Charger was really impressive.  It had excellent charging speeds and the ports had a lot of compatibility with various devices.  The prongs fold up and it is a small unit that would be great for travel.

Yes, the fold up outlet prong is fantastic, but the best part is that each port is labeled for what it can charge.  Often times you will see the outlets described in the user sheet that comes with the product, but lose that paper, and your outlets are no longer identified.  This charger has 4 universal ports you can use to charge anything, but 2 of those ports have special designations as well.  It has been found that some iDevice's and Samsung Android products require specially designed charging ports to draw a charge.

And the skeptic in me was glad there is built-in over-heated, over-current, and over-charging protection. There is nothing like thinking that a new device might fry your expensive electronics.

Some, like a couple of USB-charging razors, and wireless Bluetooth headphones, don't even exchange data with a computer. Still, when they're out of juice they need to either occupy a slot in my computer or an outlet on my wall. Even items like an iPod, an iPad, a Kindle, and a few camcorders, that sometimes do need to exchange data, usually just need a charge so they're ready to go. Both are prime real estate - I only have two USB ports, after all, and not all of the plugs I use accommodate the triple sockets I need to plug in a power strip. I often find myself at work, plugging in a couple devices to charge them, then switching them out for an external hard drive or a thumb drive when I need files from that - it's a bit of a juggling act. Also, because of the many things I have plugged into my laptop nearly all the time, I can't even bring it onto my lap and lean back. I leave it on the desk, plugged in.On top of that juggling act, there's the juggling I often have to do just to find the right plug for my various devices. With this one, as long as I have a few USB cords that plug into either standard, mini or micro USB plugs (and I have several of each of those lying around in my \"junk drawers\" both at home and in my office) I can charge anything. It is very handy. Plug it in, and it's small enough on a power cord or wall socket not to occupy more space than one plug, but it nevertheless allows me to charge up to four different devices. I haven't found anything of the many things I own that it can't charge and charge fairly quickly - certainly faster than if I plugged it in via USB. As mentioned, it's small and lightweight. I throw it in my bag when I come home, so that I can use it there if I need it, and then bring it back to my office where I almost certainly need it.This is a very useful device that has simplified my routines at work and at home.

The headphones have both things I like about them and things I do not like about them. I found that the quality of sound is quite good. I love not having a cord that gets tangled. However the ear pieces are fairly large and the fact that they stick out of my ears so much makes them slip out occasionally either because I catch them on something or from sweat. The bluetooth range is limited (the sound starts breaking up), however in my use of having MP3 in my shirt pocket they work ok. The overall rating of this headset for me is OK - not bad, but I encountered some issues.DETAILED OBSERVATIONS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1. The headset has a good sound, I tried different music and it performed well at different ranges, including Bach Toccata and Fugue in D minor which is a stress test for the bass that I use to test different speakers. Some speakers crackle and can't handle it, but this headset handled it very well.2. The ear pieces are fairly large, they are 1 3/8\" from the tip to the cord, 1\" outside the ear. The size is large because they house the battery as well as the audio components. I find they stick out of my ears quite a bit, occasionally catches on thing and slip out. They would not work well with a winter hat on. I find them to be less comfortable than the small ear pieces of my other bluetooth headset (Kinivo).3. The headset has a flat soft cord that lays on your shoulder. See photo I am attaching as the image might explain this better than words, see photo #2.The flat cord does not twist or tangle, I like it. However its length catches on my collar and earrings. I have another bluetooth wireless headset which has a rigid headband that I like better because it is shorter and does not catch on anything.4. Controls are located on the cord, you have to locate them by touch when you are wearing the headset. (see photo #3 which shows close-up of the control)5. The LED light is fairly small and it is hard to see especially in the bright light (see photo #5)6. The earphones come with three three sets of ear tips for small, medium and larger ears. I switched the the small tips so I can insert them deeper in my ear canal. (Photo #1 shows all inserts and tabs that come with this headset)7. The volume of the headset can be made quite loud. The volume at its highest setting is uncomfortably loud for me, so they go pretty high.8. The range is advertised as 33 feet, but I get some break up at that distance. On the other hand I use these headphone with the device in my shirt pocket, so the distance has not been an issue other than when I tested the range.CAPABILITIES~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.

So I was able to put the distance of about a full room (including a solid wall) between myself and this headset, and still had reception. And this was with the headset only being charged a very short time. So needless to say, while I've been using the headset with my phone in my pocket, I've had no problems at all.Design:The cord on these headphones has an unusual flat shape. The charging cable also has the same flat design. The cables have a rubbery matte finish, and are fairly flexible. Located on the cord of the headphones is a volume and power button, which handles everything from answering phone calls to adjusting your music volume. Included with the headphones is a little baggy full of different sized rubber ear tips, so you can find the one right for your ear size. I always appreciate extra included sizes, since my ears are pretty small, and regular size ear-bud tips tend to be too large for my ears, and eventually cause discomfort.Charging:These headphones run off a rechargeable internal battery, that's located right inside of right ear-bud. The included charging cable is unique, being made for just this headset. So if you lose your charging cable, you won't be able to charge your headset any more. It charges using two tiny connections on a clip that's designed to fit on the headset in the \"open\" position. It took me a few minutes to figure out exactly how the charging cable attached to the headset. The other end is a USB connection, so it can be charged through your computer's USB ports. Or if you have aUSB wall charging adapter, you can use that with the charging cable to charge the headset with a wall outlet. There is a red LED light on the headset that identifies if the battery is charged or not. I tested the headset to see if it could be powered on while plugged in and charging and it couldn't.Sound and conclusion:The music from these headphones sounds great with everything I've tested them with (hard rock, classic blues and a mix of a few others). They're great for wearing while working out, walking the dog, cleaning or working around the house, or anything other activity where you don't want to be tethered with a long headphone cable running from your headset to your phone. It pairs on the first time every time, and my headset has great Bluetooth reception, letting me go easily 15+ feet away before the signal starts to fade. I've been so pleased with everything about these, and have had nothing but good results with them. Definitely a 5 star product in my book!A sample of this product was provided for reviewing purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've had nothing but good results with the Bluetooth reception", "unixReviewTime": 1371340800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2013"}

They offer ok sound performance, but they rarely have enough volume to allow me to use them while mowing my lawn. The DinoTwin T1 are different - they offer bluetooth connectivity but they are able to cancel enough of the ambient noise so that I can mow my lawn while listening to Pandora.Notes-- Pairs easily with bluetooth devices - simply hold the power button until the earbuds flash red.- Sound quality is very solid but not quite exceptional.... the frequency response covers the entire spectrum - the bass is not booming but it does offer clean sound. While it does not offer the soundstage of some of the earbuds at higher price points it is more than acceptable.- The noise canceling capability was better than expected - I used the DinoTwin while on my riding lawn mower, and while they do not cancel all of the noise of the mower they did cancel enough of the noise to allow me to listen without much disturbance.- Offers 4 hours of listening time- Inline remote for answering calls- I really like the innovative connector that clips onto the earbuds for charging. It did take me a minute or two to figure out how they connected, but once I figured out how they connected I was amazed at how well it worked.- Comes with a variety of earbud tips and tabs for a variety of ear sizes.- I did have an issue that the earbuds became a bit uncomfortable after about 3 hours of use - not a big deal but they do feel a bit hard in my ears.- The earbuds fit, but I did need to adjust them on occasion.- The bluetooth range isn't 30 feet, but I typical keep my bluetooth device nearby when I use the earbuds.- Oddly the cord seems to be a bit short - while it is long enough to go from ear-to-ear. The shorter cord does mean that you don't have to worry about tangles.Final Verdict - The Dinotwin earbuds are effective bluetooth earbuds.

After just a couple of months use, the sound in the left bud became muted or cut on and off. Powering it on/off would sometimes cure it, but oftentimes not.  More significant is that the battery life has gone down drastically -- a full charge will now only last for less than one hour.I still like the design, but the durability is suspect. 2 stars.>>>>Original review>>>I'm really impressed with these bluetooth earbuds. I use bluetooth buds mainly for when I'm exercising, and am picky about comfort and having them stay put. These excel on both counts. They come with three tip sizes (small, medium and large) which allowed me to adjust the fit (small works best for me). They have yet to jar loose even when doing cardio work. But, even with the tight fit, no ear fatigue or soreness. Excellent!Pairing them with my Fire was simple - just press and hold the center button and the Fire picked it up in a couple of seconds. It retains the pairing without any problems.The build quality appears very good. It has a rubberized feel to the cable, which makes it comfortable and sweat resistant.The charging cradle is very nicely designed. It has a clip that attaches to the right bud and makes contact with two small pins. Just put on the clip and plug it into a USB port. The clip and cord are very compact and easy to carry/store.The sound quality is decent. These are not audiophile-quality buds, but I found the sound to be excellent for movies, and quite good for music. Decent amount of bass, and relatively clear mid and high range. Good separation. I was especially impressed with the sound isolation. With these in my ears and the sound off, I could just barely hear a loud treadmill in operation.The range was good. I maintained a connection at several feet without any drops, and was able to go further with just an occasional minor drop out.Comfortable, good quality sound, secure fit, good range, great sound isolation and easy to use. A great value for the price (currently about sixty bucks).

For years I've worn earbuds while I wait for my train or walk to the bus. I even wear them when I go grocery shopping so I don't have to listen to the junk they pump through the sound system at the store. But earbuds connected to my phone in my pocket aren't completely practical. It's always a shocker when I catch the cable on something (or drop my phone) and the buds rip out of my ears. These Bluetooth earbuds completely solve this problem, because now I don't have any wires tethered to my phone. This really gives me some freedom. For example, I can set my phone on the kitchen counter and listen to these while I move around in the kitchen while I cook. That's very handy.I was doubtful at first. I had questions, like:* How would you charge them?* How frustrating is the pairing?* Do they sound any good?* Does the charge last very long?I really don't like proprietary cables, but there really isn't any alternative way to charge these earbuds. You get a USB cable with a clip and two contact points (+/-) on the other end. You line up the + and - contacts and clip the cable to one of the buds. They charge up pretty quickly, but it's probably easier just to let them charge overnight. I keep a one-gallon ziplock baggie in my laptop bag with all of my proprietary cables, so I'll just drop this one in with the mix.I've paired them up with my iPhone and my Windows laptop. The iPhone pairing was done literally in seconds. The Windows pairing took a little longer, because Windows is a pain. It worked just fine though. So now with these paired to my PC, I can listen to them at my desk and not have a long earphone cable connected to my machine. That's pretty nice.The sound is great. I was surprised. These sound way better than I expected for this price range. I regularly use two other very high-end sets of earbuds that run in the $200 range, so I expected to be disappointed by the sound of these. I was pleasantly surprised though. These sound just fine. They don't have the same range as my more expensive earbuds, but I'll settle for a slight drop in quality in exchange for the incredible convenience of these Bluetooth buds.Just to be conservative I plugged these in to charge every time I used them very long in one day. Since I realized I had no idea how long the charge actually lasted, I decided to stop charging them and drain them all the way. I've been using them for at least a couple of hours a day for a few days. Today the charge died and I had to plug them in. I realized though that I forgot to make a note of when I stopped charging them or how many actual hours I was using them for. So my very unscientific answer is: hmmm, seems like it was at least 4-5 days at 2-3 hours per day. Sorry that's not very helpful. The reality is that the charge lasted quite a while--longer than I'd expect for something so small.I have a couple of people with birthdays coming up and I'm seriously considering giving sets of these as gifts, because they are very practical and they seem a lot more extravagant than they actually are.I was provided this item for review.____________________________EDIT:  11/4/13Mine just died.  I've used and abused these earbuds and I guess they just couldn't take it anymore.  I've used these for hours a day since I got them almost six months ago.  The power button was always a little difficult to turn on, and it got more difficult over time.  Now they just won't turn on at all.  I've tried and tried, but they just won't power on.  That's a shame, because these have been such great earbuds and I've come to rely on them.  Oh well.  They were fantastic while they lasted.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love these buds", "unixReviewTime": 1370563200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2013"}

In my opinion there is absolutely no other way to unobtrusively listen to the music while you exercise. However, all the headsets that I've used so far have one major problem: they all fail due to the moisture within a very short period of time. So this is one of the main reasons why I was excited to try out the DinoTwin headphones in the first place: their unique charging cable promises to remove one of the main sources of failure for the sports headphones: the charging jack. Only time will tell if this feature is indeed effective at this task, but so far I have been very positively impressed with these headphones.The sound quality of these headphones is one of their main attractions. First of all no wireless headphones of this size will ever be able to deliver the deep, clear sound that you expect form some of the higher end headphones, but these headphones sound richer and more vibrant than almost all the headphones I've tried before. They were on par or better than the Motorola S line of Bluetooth sports headphones, and miles better than the Jabra headphones.These headphones seem to feature passive noise canceling technology. They are pretty good at minimizing the outside sound while in use, and even when they are turned off. Several times I was in a situation where someone tried to talk to me while I was wearing them, and I had to take them off in order to hear what the person had to say.These headphones are probably the most reductionist ones that I've seen. They are just made out of two oversized earbuds and a connecting cord between them. This, IMHO, is the ideal form factor for the sports headphones. The earbuds are pretty large and stay firmly in my ears even during the moderately fast runs. The connecting cord loops around the ears, which gives the headphones extra stability. I've used them while running for several weeks and they stay firmly in the position. They score high on both the form factor and the comfort level.I have not used these headphones much for phone calls. In general I fund Bluetooth headsets to be quite inadequate for voice phone calling. The ones with solid noise cancelling (like these) are actually even worse for the purpose of phone calling - they don't provide the kind of audio feedback from your own voice that we are used to. The mic on these headphones also seemed below average, but then again, I was not going to use them for telephony anyways, so this aspect of the headphones neither bolsters nor diminishes a case for them.Even though these headphones paired easily with my iPhone, they did exhibit some issues. I was not able to turn them off while I was close to another Bluetooth device that my iPhone was paired with. I also found them to have a limited connectivity range, and the battery power, although adequate for two to three workouts, is a bit lower than some of the other headphones that I used in the past.I will be monitoring these headphones for the foreseeable future. If they manage to survive a year of use in the gym, and their battery power does not significantly diminish over that period of time, then they might be the best overall sports Bluetooth headphones that I have come across. However, until then a few issues that I came across mean that I cannot give them more than four stars out of five.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Really Good Sports Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1373500800, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2013"}

I thought putting a Bluetooth transceiver in an SDHC memory card was amazing enough, but even more remarkable are the DinoTwin Bluetooth wireless headphones, which have built-in Bluetooth, a rechargeable battery, and a microphone. But the Bluetooth isn't just a gimmick - the sound quality of these earphones equals or surpasses any wired earphones that I've used, and the absence of a cable connecting the earphones to the sound source allows a freedom of movement that makes using conventional earphones seem hopelessly old fashioned and way too restrictive.My primary interest was in using the earphones with my tablet for music. They paired very easily with my Nexus 7 (no password required), and they worked perfectly in playing my music playlists. All functions of the earphone controller worked, including volume control, pause/play, and forward/back. The sound quality was as good or better than I've heard with any earphones, and the bass notes were excellent. With some music, there was noticeable distortion at the maximum volume, but this volume was loud enough to hurt my ears. At normal sound levels, there was no noticeable distortion. The maximum range is stated to be 10 meters (33 feet), and that appeared to be accurate, since I roamed all over our house with no dropouts. While walking around, I tried using the built-in microphone with a dictation app on my Nexus 7, and it worked very well. (I was a bit skeptical about the microphone, since it's located on the right earphone instead of on the cord, but it picked up my voice just fine.)The quickstart manual that comes with the earphones is thorough enough, but the photo showing how to connect the earphones to the charging clip doesn't really make it clear how to do this. I referred to the picture on the Amazon product page, which shows the connection clearly.The medium-size earbuds that were installed with the earphones worked for me, but the accessories included a set of small and large earbuds. With the three sizes available, these should fit almost anyone comfortably.I'm impressed with the DinoTwin earphones.

Just recently I was at a LONG (+8 hours) and BORING meeting. I passed the time by checking my email, checking the weather, viewing maps, and etc on my iPhone. Unfortunately, after about 5 hours of heavy usage the battery on my iPhone was starting to get weak... but never fear, I pulled out my HIPE EB-5200 and it was like having an additional battery (plus some).The thing I like the best about the Hipe EB-5200? It is certainly the value... you can easily spend 2-3x on a similar type of battery pack. The Hipe EB-5200 does everything you need at a very low price.Notes-- Even though the Hipe EB-5200 has a 1.0mA output it was able to charge my iPad (albeit slowly). In fact, 5200mAh is enough to nearly fully charge an iPad 2.- Works perfectly with my iPhone and more than doubles my battery life.- No device charging cables are included.- The Hipe EB-5200 is charged from a USB power source. Although I did have a bit of an issue with the charging plug pulling away from the cable. Not too big of a deal and it can be fixed with a little glue.- It does have an indicator showing you how much charge that remains in the battery pack.- Small and lightweight... just a little bit larger than a couple of pencil sharpeners. It is both small and light enough to easily fit into  backpack, purse, or pocket.Final Verdict - The Hipe EB-5200 is a very inexpensive way to have a back-up battery pack. While I did have a small quality issue (again nothing major) I would still highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a small, effective, and inexpensive battery back-up.4 1/2 StarsPlease Note - I received this product for reviewing purposes", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Video Review of the HIPE EB-5200", "unixReviewTime": 1363910400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2013"}

Lebryk", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "The HIPE 5200mAh battery is good looking, compact, and works well.In the crowded world of lithium ion external batteries it is the small features that make a huge difference. Just about everybody puts the same battery inside these devices since there are a limited number of manufacturers of the batteries. Once a capacity is decided on, the critical choices are the charging port, case design, bonus features, output ports, and ability to charge an iPad (or the 2Amp rate).To decide on capacity, the most common units are around 5000mAh - that will fully charge an iPhone a little over two times and an iPad realistically 40%. This size tends to be the least expensive and a lot of good value for the buck.This particular unit won my heart over with the design. I like the rectangular shape with the nicely rounded corners. It is handsome in a simple elegant manner. The white smooth plastic case feels rich and doesn't show finger prints.It also wins over so many other vendors that use a small circular charging jack. I like the micro USB charging port over the jack, but I really would prefer the sturdier more common mini USB port. Either way, the battery uses a standard cable that is easy to come by.The front panel is simple and effective. Micro USB charging port on top, a standard USB jack on the bottom, and HIPE with blue lights behind it to indicate the state of charge to four levels. There is a white power button in the middle that is used only to display the battery state of charge. When a USB cable is plugged into the unit, the unit automatically turns on and displays the battery charge. There is no need to press the button to begin charging a device.There are no bonus features on this unit, no LED light or flashlight, and no second USB port. The blue HIPE lights are pretty bright; they make a decent night light while a device is charging.The box includes the battery and a micro USB cable. There is no USB AC adapter. You will have to either supply one (the iPhone AC adapter works perfectly) or charge the battery with a computer. The battery charges reasonably fast. Oddly, I like the box a lot. The cardboard is heavy and thick, and the whole thing looks elegant. For an inexpensive battery, this is all nicely done.I was able to charge my iPhone 4s at least twice on a full battery charge. In a pinch, I was able to charge my first generation iPad, and got about an extra 30% power into that beast. The great news, the battery is not limited to 1Amp output - so the iPad charges at the higher 2Amp rate, I like that.I've tested a lot of these batteries lately. This is the most elegant of the bunch and the one I will most likely take in my laptop bag. Another vendor has a battery that has a built in flashlight and still another with a larger capacity battery with two output ports (that is my favorite for travel).Hipe has built a useable nice battery.I was provided a review sample.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Handsome", "unixReviewTime": 1364601600, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2013"}

Where I go the iPad goes.  My pictures, my accounts, my datebook, contacts, all of my music, a dozen films, miscellaneous shorter videos, all of my knitting and crochet patterns, my 3000+ recipe database, my family cookbook and about 10,000 other books all live on the iPad and go with me wherever I go.  In fact, I sometimes think that iPad should be grafted to my arm.A single charge on an iPad is good for 10 hours of use, no matter what you happen to be using it for.  Around the house that is just fine, but when my iPad comes on a road trip or hops the pond to the UK then a recharge is often in order.  Sadly, the usual car chargers are very slow (and I have to compete with recharging the phones!) and airplanes have no electrical outlets. Enter theHIPE EB-5200 5200mAh (5V/1A output) Portable Power Bank External Backup Battery and Charger, which arrived on my doorstep from the manufacturer about 10 days ago.I've had the opportunity to use the unit a number of times.  It takes just over 3 hours to charge theHIPE EB-5200 5200mAh (5V/1A output) Portable Power Bank External Backup Battery and Chargervia the USB port on my iMac (required cord included.)I've charged the iPad with the unit several times.  The first time I happened to be in the middle of something, so continued to use the iPad for about 3 hours directly off the charging unit, after which I fell asleep.  (I often fall asleep with the iPad beside me.)  When I woke up I found the HIPE empty and the iPad with a 47% charge.Most recently I recharged the iPad and deliberately did not turn it on during the process.  Recharging from a 5% red line warning took just over 3 hours (about the same amount of time as it took to charge the HIPE in the first place) and delivered a 73% charge, enough to extend the usage hours from 10 to 18.  The unit is small enough to fit in my purse.I'm off to Boston on Thursday (8 hours in the car plus waiting at the airport) to fetch my grandchild from the airport and am heading back to the UK soon myself, so I'll be giving the HIPE a workout.Grandma's $0.02 - TheHIPE EB-5200 5200mAh (5V/1A output) Portable Power Bank External Backup Battery and Chargeris a great way to take extra charging power along.

These range from about 5,000 mAh to 12,000 mAh. The tradeoff with the higher-capacity units is size, weight, and price. The Hipe EB-5200 battery pack is one of the lightest (4.7 ounces) and most compact (3.5\"x1.6\"x0.9\") units that I've seen. The solid white, rounded case looks good and is easier than most portable rechargers to carry around.The user guide indicated that the battery pack should be recharged with a DC 5V 1A maximum input. I have several AC chargers laying around, and I used a charger for an old e-ink Kindle reader (DC 5V 0.85A), which worked fine.I used the Hipe unit to recharge a Samsung smartphone and a Kindle Fire HD 7\". I did not attempt to quantitatively measure the recharging time, but with the Samsung smartphone, the phone was charging at about 0.5% per minute for the period I observed, and the phone can be used while it's charging. My smartphone's battery has an 1800mAh capacity, and the Kindle Fire's battery has 4400mAh capacity. Theoretically, the Hipe EB-5200 should have the capacity to completely recharge the smartphone two times, and about one time for the Kindle Fire HD's battery. Those numbers should be typical for most smartphones and 7\" tablets.Overall, I was very impressed with the HIPE EB-5200 portable battery. The build quality appears to be very solid. With its light weight, compact size, and low price, the unit should appeal to many users of mobile devices who need a battery boost by the end of the day.Note that no AC wall charger or car charger is included. The Hipe recharger does include a 7\" USB/Micro USB cable that can be used for recharging both the EB-5200 (from a wall charger or car charger) and a portable device (from the EB-5200).

TheHIPE EB-5200 5200mAh Portable Power Bankwill keep you powered longer, and help you avoid situations like that.The first thing you'll notice about the HIPE power bank is the size; it balances the right size with a good amount of power.  This is the perfect size for tossing in a day bag or purse, or keeping in your pocket for unexpected needs.  The unit's design is very simple with an on/off button, an in-port (Micro-B) for charging the unit and an out-port (USB) for charging your devices.  What's great is that it can be recharged with a Micro-B USB cable which a lot of tablets and phones use today.  This is perfect for taking on trips where you don't want to bring a specialty charging cable along just to recharge the power bank.  Included in the box is a one (1) foot USB to Micro-B cable used for recharging the unit.  It can be recharged either via computer or with a wall USB charger like the one included with your Smartphone or tablet.One feature found on this unit, which is not common to find on most power banks, is that the charging port is automatic.  This allows the unit to turn on, beginning a charge the moment you plug any device into it, and it will auto-shut off when you unplug your device.  It's an amazing feature that saves you time in both turning the unit on and off.  The unit also features an LED display that indicates the charge level by how many letters of the product name \"HIPE\" are illuminated.This power bank is great for use with small devices.  This can provide up to two full charges for many mobile phones, and will provide a good amount of charge for most tablets.TheHIPE EB-5200 5200mAh Portable Power Bankis priced right and it is very compact for the amount of charge it can provide.

The output is 5V/1A. It has a high enough output to provide power for a tablet although not enough capacity to fully charge a tablet such as an iPad. But it will charge an iPhone. and phones with similar battery capacity, approxmately 2 times.The enclosure is glossy white and attractive in its simplicity. On one end is a micro-USB charging port and the USB 5v/1A output port. A 13\" USB to micro-USB cable is provided, suitable for either charging the battery pack or for use as a cable to attach to a device using micro-USB for charging the device. The cable that came with my battery pack was of poor quality and the cover detached from the cable end when I was removing the cable from the battery pack.A LED under the HIPE logo on the same end as the ports gives you an indication of the state of charge of the battery pack. Depending on how many LED\"s are lit, indicates charge:4 lights = 75-100% charge.3 lights = 50-75% charge2 lights = 25-50% charge1 light - 0-25% charge.A momentary press of the small white button beneath the LED logo turns the display on long enough just so you can determine the charged state of the battery. The button serves no other function.The feature I really like about this battery pack is the fact that it is auto-sensing. You do not have to turn it on to charge a device or remember to turn it off once a device has been charged and the cable disconnected from the battery pack. The unit is auto-sensing. As soon as you plug a cable into the battery packs' USB output port, it turns on and is ready to charge your device.When charging is complete and you remove the cable from the battery pack, the battery pack powers down automatically. However, if you leave a cable plugged in, the battery pack will not automatically power off. In this case the battery pack will be in a state of slow discharge. The takeaway here is to always remember to disconnect the output cable when you are done using the battery pack.When the battery pack is charging, the HIPE logo LED will blink.You are able to charge a device at the same time the battery pack is being charged.This is a well-designed, compact and good performing battery pack. The 5200 mAh capacity is a nice size as it remains relatively compact in size yet provides a good deal of power.If I had not received a defective cable this would earn 5-stars.

In most cases you will need to have your OEM charge cable with you, unless your device can be charged via Micro USB. This means the iPhone and other iDevices will require you to still carry around your charge cable (not the adapter if applicable, just the cable).Recharge time on the battery is about 6 hours total. The included manual recommends you recharge the battery completely before trying to use it for the first time. I assume this is because of the fear of battery \"memory.\" I recharged the battery per their instructions (out of the box it was about 60-90 minutes). Once it is depleted, then the charge time is about 6 hours as mentioned above.The battery is bang on simple to use. When you want to charge, just plug the microusb end into the battery's \"input\" connector then connect the standard USB end into any wall adapter you might have. You can also recharge via a USB port on a PC, though if you are using your laptop on battery power, realize you will be draining your battery further when charging the EB-5200 this way. It's also faster to charge with a 2 Amp charge over a 1 Amp, and this is also the case when charging via USB on a PC.When you want to recharge your phone or other device, simply plug the device's USB charge cable into the Output port on the battery. Once it is connected, press the Power button on the battery and the device should begin to charge. While your device is charging, the word \"hipe\" is illuminated. As the different letters in the word go out, this indicates the power level of the EB-5200. When none of the lights are illuminated when you press the power button on the battery, it means the battery is drained.At the full capacity of 5200mAh, you should be able to get at least 2 complete recharges of an iPhone with this device.The external battery, for a battery, is pretty light. It's designed small enough to fit in your pocket so in theory, if you keep the phone in your pocket as well, you could charge the phone while both are in your pocket. If you have a hip holster and a long enough charge cable, you could leave the battery in your front pocket and connect the power cable to the phone on your hip.I have another backup battery I've used and I must say, it is nowhere near as nice as the Hipe.

They're not stiff in the least, and this creates comfort when wearing them. I could wear these all day without developing physical fatigue, I believe. There are 3 replacement tips of varying sizes. All of them bend easily and thus I'm guessing they'd all work for the average person.The sound is definitely the best of any earbuds I've used. I think all the connectors are high quality and produce the difference. This is a rich, full sound. I tested the switch that allows me to answer the phone and it seemed seamless and with good sound quality again.In my opinion, this set of earbuds with the replacement tips is a great value proposition. I think a lot of people will be happy with them.

I listened to various music genera on iTunes radio &#8211; classical, pop, electronic, etc., and these headphones were able to handle all of them quite well, to the point that I forget that I am wearing the headphones and just lose myself in music.There are a couple of things about these headphones that I didn&#8217;t quite like. I do miss the ability to control the volume and skip tracks directly on the headphones cable. Furthermore, when I used these headphones to make phone calls, people at the other end of the line were not able to hear me very clearly, although I was more than satisfied with the sound quality. This means I will probably go back to my iPhone headphones when it comes to placing phone calls.Overall, however, I am really happy with these headphones.

The `Aleratec' manages to really give a solid bass boost and a bass drum feel that is perfectly synced and balanced with the mid and high range tones.  The drivers really must be high premium.  The acoustic sound and precise bass will make you toss out any other set of ear buds.  Only a good headset around your ears can produce a better sound.Unlike other ear buds, the 3.5mm jack is set at a right angle to prevent accidental pull-outs.  The bright red cord is flat, not round, so you won't get all tangled up like with typical ear buds; i.e., iPhone ear buds.  This is a nice design correction.The in-line microphone is an easy click to switch to phone calls and switching between music and calls is easy and feels intuitive.  When a phone call comes in, the sound of voices sound normal; not too tinny or bassy. The `noises isolation' actually works very well with the exclusionary action of outside noises.You know those Apple ear buds that always fall out of your ear?  These fits in your ears perfectly without fear of falling out while running or biking.  The simply design just works - these inventors know their stuff.The nicely packaged box (this is a great gift for birthdays, holidays or, um, new dates) also comes with extra ear plugs Gels (S, M, L) and a nice black felt bag for all.

'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period.

With the advent of iPads and other power-hungry devices they've been problematic.  The Bolse has 3.1 amps total in the dual port rather than the typical 2.1, something that doesn't cut the mustard with the power hogs.  In reality, the older chargers were bridging and didn't even deliver on that 2.1 amps.Simultaneous charging is a real plus with the Bolse.  You simply use your own USB devices cables.  The charger is very solid and the added length adds to its stability.  An LED light on the interface indicates that a charge is in progress.  Not all cars are created equal and neither are their 12v sockets.  The spring-loaded power contacts insure a tight fit.  It's totally frustrating to buy anything that won't fit in a wide variety of vehicles.The strategically designed circuit will prevent over-heating, over-charging and excessive current.  Each port on the interface is clearly marked as are the input and output specifications on the side.

Included is the charger its self and an instruction manual. This is a really good car charger for many reasons, the first reason is because of the fact that it is a Dual USB Car charger, this also pretty much makes it a universal charger as you can charge the device of your choice, no need for a proprietary car charger as long as you have the USB cable for that device. There is an exception to this, the charger is not compatible with IPD, the HP TouchPad, the Asus Transformer, and the Motorala Xoom. Aside from these you should be able to charge any other devices. The two outputs of this charger are at 1 Amp and at 2.1 Amps, the 1 Amp output is mainly for your phones, the charger also offers charging at 2.1 Amps which is more suitable for tablets and larger devices. It isn't however limited to charging tablets at 2.1 Amps, you can also connect say an iPhone there and it should charge at about twice the rate of that of the 1 Amp output. This is great because sometimes you just need to charge a device faster than others. I tested this with an HTC EVO 3D, and an iPad in the 2.1 Amps output and the two devices charged simultaneously with no problems what so ever. For the price, you can't go wrong with this charger, it even comes with a 12 month warranty! It is sturdy and solid and it seems that it will last a long time. I can highly recommend this product, and thus I rate it a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review has helped you out!I was provided a sample for testing and evaluation, my review of this product is honest and the words above are my own.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An excellent car charger that is worth your money!", "unixReviewTime": 1372118400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2013"}

These days, Americans are holding on to older cars for a lot longer, and many of these vehicles don't have a USB port; some are lucky to have even one cigarette lighter.  That's where a product like this, which can make so much use out of one cigarette lighter port, is seriously nifty.The charger features two (2) USB ports with a combined power output capacity of 3.1 Amps (5v).  The ports are labeled \"2.1 amp\" and \"1.0 amp,\" respectively.  The 2.1 amp port is great for charging my tablet either a Kindle Fire HD or Nexus 7.  Both had no issue drawing a charge from this unit.  The 1.0 amp port is ideal for my low capacity devices like my Smartphone or mp3 player.The unit features a blue LED light to indicate it is plugged in and working, but compared with similar chargers I don't find the light overpowering or annoying, though it's great to know its working when driving at night. The dual USB port charger is very compact; making it easy to move from vehicle to vehicle.  For size and weight, the charger, feels durable; time will tell if it can hold up to use - and I believe it will.  It's just right, having a snug, secure fit for a great connection.All things considered, theBolse 3.1 Amp Dual USB Port Chargeris a very good buy, well worth the price.Review of Bolse 4.2Amp 20W High Output Turbo Charge Dual USB Port Car Charger for iPad, iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 / S4, Amazon Kindle Fire, etc.:TheBolse 4.2Amp 20W High Output Turbo Charge Dual USB Port Car Chargersolves one big problem in the car.

This is perfect for charging two tablets at the same time, or even a tablet and a smartphone.  The charger is very compact and has a good fit in the lighter socket.  The unit features a changeable fuse and I find it runs much cooler than other types of car chargers I have.

I use my iPhone for navigation, but that drains the battery quickly. Using the Bolse Car Charger I received from the manufacturer for review purposes, I no longer have to worry about that.

It doesn't have that cheap plastic feel that looks like it would break if you don't treat it gently. Where the charger shines is with the two charging ports that have both 1 amp and 2.1 amp power options. With my iPhone, the 1 amp version works fine. However, the iPad sucks a lot more power for charging, and having the 2.1 amp option rocks. Having *both* of them in a single device (meaning I can charge/use both my iPhone and iPad at the same time) makes this a perfect charging option. It's also priced at under $10 on Amazon, which makes it a steal in my opinion. At that price, I'd make sure to have one in any car I own, or perhaps even include it as a regular item in an electronic travel kit just in case you end up going somewhere in a friend's car.If you're not fortunate enough to have a built-in USB plug in your car (or if you only have one port), buying the Bolse Car Charger would be a great addition to your car.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid power adapter to keep your iPhone/iPod/iPads running on the road...", "unixReviewTime": 1368403200, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2013"}

On the other hand, if you only want a piece-of-mind backup charger to make a call or two in a dire emergency, there are chargers available that are only the size of a business card and fit in your wallet.  Of course, there are hundreds of external chargers out there for every type of situation in between these two.Only you can determine what a &#34;scary&#34; long time means to you, but if you think you will need to re-charge your phone and your tablet more than once before you see a charging source, or if you only have a phone and you will want to re-charge it maybe five times before finding a normal charging source--you should consider this charger.But at a little over a half pound, this is not the charger for the pocket of your jeans or your evening bag.  In a laptop briefcase, in a backpack, in a larger-size purse or in carry-on luggage, the size of this will be inconsequential.

It assumes that you have never used an external charger before.  I am very impressed with the simple, little manual.  I wish all manuals worked so well.--It has a digital read-out that clues you in to exactly what it is charging at the moment and how much charge power is left.  There is no ambiguity, no guesswork at all.--It has a flashlight!  I always carry a small flashlight with me.  Having the charger and the light in one piece prevents clutter and helps me rationalize the half-pound heft.I've read other reviews--older reviews--that mention defective chargers.  I see also that the company representative has admitted to some defective chargers early on, and that Maxboost customer service seems to be very easy to work with.  I believe that the problem has been fixed, and I can say that the charger I received is working just fine.

There are two USB ports, and one of them is specifically able to source the 2.1A required to charge an iPad in maximum charge mode.  I hooked this up and got my iPad charging immediately.Second, the battery has a nifty LED screen that actually reads out the amount of power remaining in percent, and tells you the state of the battery.

Not only that, but with up to 6 devices when we travel, a high capacity external battery is necessary.This is an 10000mAh battery, the highest I've used to date. Note however that Julian from Maxboost says in one of the comments that all high quality battery chargers have a 30% energy conversion loss and the net power available is 7000mAh, which is in line with my experience.The charger itself is quite compact for its power and very well designed. It's mono-colored with an LCD readout showing the power left/used in percentages. This is great because most batteries only have lights or colors to show usage but this is more precise. There are two outputs, a 2.1A for larger devices and 1.0A for smaller ones (such as phones).The battery works as well as expected. We've used this to charge iPads, iPods, e-readers and all different kinds of phones and have no problems. Using it to recharge 3 phones during a day out, we weren't able to exhaust the charger so we're very pleased with that. But using it to recharge an iPad will use up most of its charge. Still, I would expect this charger to be able to charge an iPad and one phone several times from one whole charge.The battery also comes with a small LED light, activated by pressing the button twice. It's not very strong and some of the light leaks out through one of the USB ports!One of the best things I like about this charger is that the charging cable comes with inter-changeable heads. It has the mini USB, micro USB and Apple iPod head so you can charge devices need those heads. The carrying pouch is another nice inclusion to prevent the battery from getting scratched.Bottom line, this is a high capacity battery charger at a very decent price. On long day trips or traveling, I would recommend the highest capacity charger possible and this would be a good choice.Note: Sample was provided for review.

Now that many newer Android smartphones follow the iPhone route and close off a battery compartment, external chargers appear to be gaining in necessity. This Maxboost 10000 mAn Dual-port 3A Premium USB Portable External Battery differs from other chargers, in my experience, five ways.1) It's heftier. Over about half a pound at least. It's more rugged, on the other hand, as a trade-off. Probably too heavy for a pocket, but in a pouch, backpack or luggage, a better fit.2) It's readable. The blue LED as the product description displays above makes this more precise in its readout in bigger black letters on a brighter blue background. This allows more precision as to estimating (the claim is to 1%) how much or how little of a charge is needed.3) It's laid out thoughtfully. The added flashlight button is easily turned on (and &#34;off&#34; needs as the helpful instructions remind you, just an added push for a short time) as an added bonus. It's easy to hold in the hand with its curved shape rather than a brick like other chargers, and so it fits well into the palm.4) Mini-USB and an Apple-compatible plug are provided as options and a small case is also sent along, a thoughtful touch. Finally, the dual ports for 2.1 tablet or 1 phone are engraved with their respective entries. This may be harder to make out in the dark as it's black on black, but it does not wear away easily.5) As the comments you can find here show, Maxboost is attentive to customer feedback.

Unfortunately I couldn't use the flashlight to read the print on the flashlight.  The flashlight isn't extremely bright, but could be very useful in a pinch.I have noticed that, when not in use, the iPad gets about 1.5% life for every 1% of the battery display level.  So that's cool.  The battery drops life faster at the beginning of the charge but then it seems to level off.  (This means absolutely nothing, but it is my OCD)  if you use the tablet while charging, the charger drops must faster and the iPad energy goes up, but far less quickly.I knock this a half of a star because it is a little heavy.

The physical dimensions and weight are: 2 7/8 inches  by 4 1/4 inches by 1 inch, 8 ounces. After extensive testing and re-charging, this battery charger is the best device charger among the number of electronic battery chargers I have tested in recent months.During the test, the Maxboost Pulse charged an iPhone5 in 1 hour and 56 minutes while simultaneously charging a Kindle Touch in 3 hrs and 30 minutes, with 42% of MaxBoost Pulse capacity remaining, which could have charged an iPhone or similar device at least twice. At the beginning of the test, the iPhone 5 was up for use in 4 minutes, while the Kindle Touch was up for use in 16 minutes.

This gets the user's device 'up and running and in the green status' on the device's `% meter' faster than chargers I have tested which usually charge at a 1% per minute rate (for example this Pulse charger reached 25% in 20 minutes).

One unique feature of this external power pack is that it has a micro USB cable built into the side of the unit (see attached photo collage). It pops out of the side on a coiled cable, so if your mobile device takes a micro USB connector you don't need to carry any extra cables. This built-in cable delivers very rapid charging (see test results below). The power pack also has a port which allows you to connect other connectors, so it works with devices that have proprietary connectors as well.I tested Ultra Slim 3200mAh External Battery Pack with Galaxy Nexus Phone (running ICS 4.0.4), Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet (running ICS 4.0.4) and iPad Mini.I received this power bank from the manufacture for an honest review be it positive or negative. Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.I received two identical units black and white, having two of them allows me to test for consistency in manufacturing. Ideally I want to see the same performance numbers for both units, and this was the case with the two Ultra Slim power packs .My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; General features:======================Ultra Slim 3200mAh external battery weighs 3.2 oz. Its size is 2.25\" x4.25 \" x 0.375\". The pack has one USB output port and one built-in micro USB cable.In addition to the built-in micro USB cable Ultra Slim comes with a charging cable and two tips - micro USB and iPad. It did not have tips for Samsung Galaxy Tab or lightening connector for iPad Mini and I used my own charging cables during the tests. I am attaching a photo of the Ultra Slim 3200mAh during one of the test next to my tablet for size reference. You can find this photo by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo in this listing.Ultra Slim 3200mAh looks very slick: it is thin, has a nice finish, and in general has a look and shape of a smart phone. It shows the charge level by displaying 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% on panel. When it is charging, however, this indicator gets turned off. But the charging continued even when the lights were off. This is a little different from how other external power pack indicators work (they stay on when you are charging),so I wanted to mention it. In addition to the charging capabilities, Ultra Slim has a built-in flashlight.&#10152; Test Results:======================&#10004; Galaxy Nexus Phone~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutes (built-in mciro USB charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutes (built-in mciro USB charging cable)White unit: AC ~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10004; Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10004; iPad Mini tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10152; Key finding:======================&#10004; This power pack has great performance with built-in micro USB cable.&#10004; Using your own charging cables the power pack works with both Galaxy 7.7 Tablet and iPad Mini but performance is on the slow side.&#10004; I observed the same performance for both the black and white model, which is good and reflects consistency in the manufacturing process.I highly recommend this power pack to people who can take advantage of the built-in micro USB cable.Note: the photo collage referenced in the review can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo.Ali Julia review", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Built-in micro USB cable delivers great performance", "unixReviewTime": 1373155200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2013"}

I also have (and have reviewed) the white version. Rather than repeat the review, I'll summarize the main points: this is a nicely made, very slim (about 3/8 inch thick) powerbank that works well. What it lacks in terms of charge capacity it makes up for in ease of carrying around.Like the white version, the only major issue I have with this is the micro USB cable that is built into the device. While this is a good idea since it makes the power bank easier to use, the cord length is too short for comfortable use (about 4 inches long fully extended) and it can be a pain to recoil the cord so that it fully retracts into the power bank body. That's the main reason for a loss of one star.However, the black version also has another strike: it is a major fingerprint magnet. While I'm sure the white version attracts as many fingerprints since it also has a glossy finish, you have the benefit of not seeing them. That's not the case with the black version - smudges galore!I won't detract a star because of that since it's strictly an aesthetic issue and has nothing to do with performance, but point it out in case you're bugged by easily smudged devices.Like the white version this does most things very well, and does so with a very small footprint that's easy to take along.

Fowler", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "There were several things I liked about this iFlash 3200 power bank as soon as I took it out of the box.  For one thing it is quite slim, compact, and easy to tuck away in a desk drawer, purse, or briefcase.  I like the power banks that are usually dubbed \"lipsticks,\" but this one is much less clunkier than any of those are.  The most interesting, and perhaps welcome thing about the iFlash, is the fact that it has an internal spring output plug.  At first I thought it was a switch, but was very pleased to note otherwise.  It comes out quite easily when you simply pinch and pull.I instantaneously knew how much power was in the battery when I pressed the button on the top face where the iFlash logo is.  Instead of simple dots or slashes accompanied by numbers, the LED lights are underneath.  The numerical panel lights up nicely with a bright blue.  If you hold the button for a couple of seconds, the mini LED flashlight comes on (reverse the process to turn it off).  I gave this small battery pack a little workout right out of the box.  I tried it out with an iPad, which it certainly isn't meant for, but was getting a surprising  2% to 3% charge every fifteen minutes.  Mind you, this little experiment was undertaken with a battery pack with probably no more than a 74% charge to begin with.This is definitely a high-quality battery pack that is set up for gift giving.  It's in a hard shell, plastic case rather than a box and is very attractive.  The box can either be recycled, use to store the battery pack or used for something else.  I'd never heard of iFlash before testing some of their battery packs, but have definitely been pleased with not only the performance, but also attention to detail.  For example, the cords are of high quality and the plugs fit quite snuggly.  iFlash stands behind their product and is offering a 1-year limited warranty.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  3200mAh power bank~  USB cable~  30-pin connector~  5-pin micro USB connectorSPECS:~ Weight: 92g (.20 pound)~ Capacity:  3200mAh~ Input: DCV/1A~ Output: DC5V/0.6A~ Output charging time:  2 - 3 hours~ Input charging time: 4 - 5  hours~ Recycling time: Unknown (probably around 500 times)~ One year limited warranty~  ROHS and CE certifiedDIMENSIONS:~  107(L)x57(W)x10(T) mm 4.17 x 2.24 x 0.4 inchesPOWER INDICATORS:(These are numerical from 25 to 100)~ Not lit up:  &lt;25%~ One LED light on: 25% - 49% (25)~ Two LED lights on: 50% - 74% (50)~ Three LED lights on: 75% - 99% (75)~  Four LED lights on: 100% (100)OPERATING PARAMETERS:~  Working Temperature:  -20 - 45 C (-4 - 113 F)~  Storage Temperature:  -20 - 60 C (-4 - 140 F)~  Working Humidity:  20% - 80%~  Storage Humidity:  20% - 90%Sample provided for review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a nice slim, high-performance 3200mAh battery pack ...", "unixReviewTime": 1373846400, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2013"}

It came with a micro USB adapter and an apple adapter for Apple devices before the lightning connector. Now power banks are usually pretty big and bulky to compensate for the battery charge that they are holding, this one is unique. This power bank offers a 3200 mAh back up which is enough to charge phones with small batteries (not smart phones) quite a couple of times and a smart phone maybe about 1 time and then another half charge. This power bank conserves battery life unlike other external batteries though, the battery indicator on most power banks light up when charging a device and that lets you know how much percentage of a charge the power bank still has, this is great but those lights that are always on can reduce the overall performance by using up some of the stored energy.When you connect a device to this power bank it immediately commences to charge, but the lights remain off! This helps improve the battery life of the iFlash power bank, a neat feature that makes this one such a good power bank. This power bank also incorporates a built in micro USB cable on the right side of the product, it is a couple inches long so it isn't that long, but just having the option of using it makes it that much better if your device charges via a micro USB cable. This addition makes it not only more usable, but more portable because you don't need to carry around the cable for that such device.The best feature of the iFlash 3200 mAh powerbank, at least to me, would have to be its design, it is an amazing design and it looks amazing. It is ultra slim, it is about a third of the thickness of my phone and unlike other power banks this one is so slim and small that you can even fit it in a pocket if you really wanted to.The only con to this powerbank is that its output is at 0.6 Amps, not necessarily a bad thing it just means that the rate of charge isn't going to be as fast as if you connected it to a charger with a 1 Amp output or 2.1 Amps. I would say that although this power bank is capable of charging tablets and pretty much any device that charges via a USB port it would be more suitable for phones in general that don't have big batteries such as the Samsung Galaxy devices since those would be better off charging at a faster rate.Overall I can highly recommend this product, you will be sure to enjoy it and you won't regret purchasing one.I rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!I was provided this product for testing and evaluation and my review of this product is completely honest and unbiased, the words stated above are my own.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A power bank that truely is portable!", "unixReviewTime": 1373414400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2013"}

They have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house.  If you are like us, you probably always have something that is low on batteries at all times.  A typical scenario in our house is someone piling the kids in the car to go to the store, or the mall, or out to eat or wherever and grabbing the iPods, only to find them dead.  Noooooooooooooo!  These are the only things that keep us sane!  So that is where a portable charging solution would be great.I was provided a Yubi Power YP250AS 2500mAh Power Bank for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.Initial Impression:  The product looks great.  I received a Silver model and it has a very nice outer metal body with plastic ends.  It looks and feels very solid in your hand.  It has one power button, one LED that lights in three colors, a micro USB input for charging the Power Bank and a normal USB Output for charging your electronics.  It is about the length of two C Batteries but not quite as thick and not very heavy at all.  It is very compact and sleek looking.  It also came with a small 9 inch Micro to Normal USB cable for charging the unit which is nice so you don't have another long cable laying around.  I doesn't have any kind of capacity gauge so you just have to have it charged up when you need it.It came with some charge to it so I plugged it into my computer and charged it until it was full.  The indicator light was red while it was charging and turned green when it was full.  It only took a few hours to top it off for the initial charge.  After it was full I did some testing.Test #1:  I took my old 3rd Gen iPod Touch that had about 15% battery left and started charging it.  The battery in the this older iPod model is smaller than current models so it should charge a little faster.  It is an old battery and isn't as strong as it used to be but it still lasts a while.  I checked it every 10 minutes or so and got the following readings.Starting Point = 15% ChargeAfter 10 Minutes = 55% ChargeAfter 20 Minutes = 85% ChargeAfter 30 Minutes = 90% ChargeAfter 45 Minutes = 100% ChargeLike I mentioned before, the old battery in this iPod isn't that great so the times/percents may not be perfect, but the important thing is it quickly gave the smaller battery on my old iPod a usable charge.  The following tests with an iPhone 5 have much more consistent results.Test #2:  I plugged in the Power Bank into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in the morning and ready to go.  Took the fully charged Power Bank and plugged in my mostly depleted iPhone 5 that had only 15% charge remaining.  I got the following readings.Starting Point = 15% ChargeAfter 15 Minutes = 31% ChargeAfter 45 Minutes = 65% ChargeAfter 75 Minutes = 88% ChargeAfter 95 Minutes = Full ChargeOverall, great results.  It was averaging about 1% per minute which seems pretty good for a 1 Amp charger.  The Power Bank had plenty of juice to fully charge a pretty low iPhone 5 without any problem.Test #3:  We took the discharged 3rd Gen iPod Touch and threw it in my Wife's purse with the Power Bank and checked it when we got to our destination where we would need an iPod to keep our daughter occupied.  It had increased the battery level to around 60% in about 20 minutes which gave us enough power to survive the trip.  It charged the iPod touch quickly and the Power Bank gave off very little heat if any in the purse.  I can see this scenario happening several times a week.Test #4:  At work, we are not allowed to plug in any unauthorized/personal electronics into the USB ports of our work computers.  That leaves me with the only option of climbing under the desk with a charger block to charge my phone at work.  Not really the best option.  While I'm at work, my Phone sits on my desk receiving emails and texts and I occasionally use it for web browsing, apps or remote access using LogMeIn.  There is no WiFi available and the LTE really eats up the battery fast.  I decided to plug in my phone to the Power Block while it was sitting on my desk and it successfully kept my Phone fully charged all day.  It was great.  I had a full battery at the end of the day.  It is a great option for charging your phone when you don't have a power plug handy.Conclusion:  Overall, the Yubi Power YP250AS 2500mAh Power Bank worked great during my initial tests and usage.  The product is compact and easy to use.  It looks and feels like a high quality piece of equipment.  The current price of $14 is competitive with the other Power Banks of this size that are available on Amazon, but the Yubi Power product looks like it is built a lot better than its competition.  I can see this as an excellent option for a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug.  My biggest problem is going to be trying to get this thing back from my Wife.  I will probably have to get a second one.

And on one of my last trips, I discovered the maps application in my iPhone 4s. I was thrilled to learn it would give me audio directions while I'm driving, pointing me right to my destination. Since I don't own a vehicle GPS, this app has become indispensable to me. In addition, with Siri built into my phone, I can simply press a button and tell her where I need to go, and she starts the route and gives me turn by turn directions. What could be better? A cell phone car mount to hold up my phone, that actually sicks to the windshield, and this one does.Gone are the days of using a traditional suction cup, where you have to wet the back of it to try and get a perfect seal on the glass. The cup on this mount uses a kind of vacuum seal that's achieved by pulling a lever down while the cup it pressed against the intended mounting surface. This creates a surprisingly strong seal. However, keep in mind that during especially cold times of the year (a.k.a winter) a drastic drop in surface temperature will likely cause the plastic in this cup to contract, thus loosing it's suction. So if you use this all year, then say it falls off your windshield right after Christmas, you might need to wait 'till the temperatures warm up a bit to make sure you don't have problems with it holding its grip. Otherwise the drastic surface temperature changes between day and night may keep it from staying properly affixed.So between the Maps app in my iPhone to route my trips, Siri to talk to me the whole way there, telling me where I need to turn and how far I have to go, and this car mount to keep my phone right in front of me so I can easily hear and access it, it's like having a built in GPS system. It even holds my iPhone 4s in it's case, aOtterbox Defender Hybrid Case.

I would like to thank LowerPriceUSA for sending me a sample to evaluate - they did so on the understanding that I would give my honest and unbiased feedback.CONSTRUCTION, QUALITY AND DESIGNThough it is made almost entirely out of plastic, this FRiEQ smartphone mount has a really slick finish, and seems very durable. I have both the white and black mounts, and without being gaudy they are rarely missed when people are in our car! The phone gripping mechanism is strong enough that I can rotate it without worrying about my phone slipping out, but the soft padding alleviates any worries about scratches to my phone itself. This mechanism also allows you to keep any cover on your phone that you may have. It struggled with an otterbox (those things are huge anyway) but with my regular hard-case I had no issues.The mount can be rotated and pivoted, and does so with ease. This is particularly handy for those moments when the sun happens to be reflecting off of the screen into your eyes - a quick push is all it takes to avoid a potential accident! Again, despite it being easy to change the position of this mount, your phone will stay where you put it if you don't want it to move!THE SUCTION CUPNow I have to be honest and say that I am one of the unfortunate few  who will not be able to use this on their dashboard. For some reason, no matter how hard I try (cleaning before placement, etc.), this simply will not stick on our older Subaru Outback. We tried on family members' dashboard and it went on just fine, so I guess it's the luck of the draw, and no stars removed! Still, the suction cup is enormously powerful, and whether you use it on your dashboard or windshield, that sucker is not coming loose! Unlike some previous generations of FRiEQ mounts, the cold does not affect the suction as much as it used to- definite points there! The suction mechanism is easily operated by a lever, and the washable gel pad was surprisingly easy to clean, dry and use again! Usually I don't trust washable adhesive products, but going with 3M was a good move, as FRiEQ now gets to benefit from 3M's high standards of performance.OVERALLDespite being one of the few people in the world with a problematic dashboard surface, these are definitely my new favorite dash mounts. Their versatility, ease of use and strong performance allow me to easily recommend them. Sure, they're a few dollars more expensive than other brands, but FRiEQ is fast-becoming a trustable name in electronics accessories, and I personally find their performance to absolutely merit the few extra dollars spent.*UPDATE*So after just a little bit of use, the spring mechanism that clamps down on the phone gave way - the mount doesn't have tension any more. It's sad, because this is my favorite mount! I have contacted the manufacturer and will be reviewing their warranty process. For now, I'm withdrawing my hearty recommendation and stating to proceed with caution - it's quite possible that this is a fluke so we'll see when/if I get a replacement.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "By far my favorite mount!", "unixReviewTime": 1370476800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2013"}

I've tried a couple of these mounts without much success.  This one you can even leave your case on provided it doesn't exceed the width.  One cautionary note would be to not put it on the dash in the airbag areas.

This mount is very versatile holding devices from 2.5 to 3.5 inches.  The hold on your device is sturdy, however it will require both hands to remove and place inside the mount.  The cradle holds tight to your device and this is great for ensuring it won't fall out while driving.The mount is solidly constructed.  I really like the suction cup design in this product. Between my radar detector and other devices (my state has very liberal laws on the use of windshield mounted devices), the suction cups can get dirty easy when moving from one vehicle to another.

When I was asked if I wanted to review the FRiEQ Premium Stylish Universal Dashboard Windshield Car Mount Holder for Smartphones, I said yes, hoping it would be the answer for those types of situations. I quickly found out that it *is* the answer, and will be permanently left in the car now... I love it.The things I normally don't care for on mounts like these is that they are built for a single size or type of phone, and you pretty much have to take off any phone cover in order to use it. Not with the FriEQ, however... The two side braces for the phone have one side that is fixed and one side that is spring-loaded and expands out to nearly four inches wide. Therefore, it's pretty irrelevant as to how wide your device is with the cover on it. Just push the side of the phone against the brace that expands out, push it until you can get the phone anchored against the other brace, and the tension between the arms will hold it tight.The base has a latch on the back that works the suction cup base on the bottom. I'd guess that if your dashboard is pebbly or not very smooth, it might not hold as tightly as it should. But for our dash, which is smooth, it held like a rock. The armature between the phone holder and the base also fully swivels and moves through a 90 degree of up-and-down motion, so I can't think of any configuration where you wouldn't be able to attach the mount and not be able to swivel the phone into an optimal viewing angle.Bottom line, I can't find anything to dislike about the FRiEQ. It looks nice in black, it blends into the coloring in our car, it's easy to work, and it does exactly what it's supposed to do (and it does it well). I'm guessing that if I find that the FriEQ is missing from my car, it will probably have \"mysteriously\" traveled to my son's car... in which case he can go buy his own.

I don't believe that it affects the content of my review or my final rating but it's fair to state it.I don't know if I qualify as an audiophile but I am definitely a sucker for good sound and can't stand the opposite. Within that context, the more little Bluetooth speakers I received for review, the more skeptical I've become on the wisdom of someone spending actually money to acquire such a device because the sound tends to be 'not good', their stereo rarely rises about the level of 'pretend', lack bass, the controls tend to look and feel cheap and some aren't much louder than the phone's or tablet's own built in speakers. Yes, there are exceptions but they almost always tend to be on the 'high end' of the price spectrum.Enter EasyAcc's entry. It's somewhat midrange pricewise and yet it delivers some very, very good quality, crisp, loud, stereo sound with decent bass. And it's quite good looking too if appreciate the Zeppelin shape. The explanation for my Four Stars rating is because 'sound' matters to me so much vs. everything else so I am really subtracting about 3 stars for other issues but the EasyAcc starts with a seven stars rating for its sound - unbelievably good for a device this size at this price point.Here is the list of features that are likely to disappoint you and could make you to look elsewhere if they are important to you. All based on my experience, of course.- Terrible, awkward interface. There is a Mode button that switches between Bluetooth and other modes such as Radio, line mode or USB/SD card but it's difficult to know where you are because there are no visual clues whatsoever except for some pulsating blue light that should indicate that the device is paired or about to pair via Bluetooth.- Radio didn't work for for me. We don't get too many stations here but EasyAcc got me none. Don't know why. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way of storing favorite stations. Going back to the interface, the manual claims that it can store up to 35 FM stations but I am unaware on how to store them and, since there is no visual feedback, assuming that stations can be stored, it should be impossible to determine which stored stations you are currently listening to, its frequency and it shouldn't be that easy to switch from, let's say 'station 5' to 'station 25'.- USB/AC card interface doesn't work. I plugged in a USB stick I use to play music in my car and plays well on both Windows and Android devices but nothing came out. As far as I can tell, IF this could be made to work, there is no random play mode, no way to search for a specific album or artist and no way to switch to another song other than sequentially move from 'song 1' to 'song 2' and so forth.- Standby time of only 18 hours. If you turn it on it's likely to stay on until the battery runs out, regardless of it receiving any input.But enough negativity. There are some other good thing to note, besides the great sound:+ Comes with a pretty good 800 mAh lithium battery that charges off any USB charger.+ USB charging wire and 3.5 mm audio cable included.+ Can play while charging+ Supports headphonesTo summarize: sound is great for something this small and it makes up for almost all shortcomings.

It can be an MP3 player by playing MP3s from either USB FLash & SD Card.  It can be a bluetooth speaker for a phone or tablet.

I listen to audio books when I do house chores and the chores go a lot faster when you have a great book to listen to. The speaker works well for this purpose because it automatically remembers where you stopped and picks up from that point the next time you start listening.  It remembers the bookmark even after you recharge the speaker, which is not the case with some of my other MP3 players.  You can listen to MP3 while the device is being charged.  The only negative I can say here is that there is no display, so you don't see what chapter you are on.&#9835; &#9835; &#9835; I tested bluetooth with my Samsung Galaxy tablet and iPad mini tablet and both worked well.&#9835; &#9835; &#9835; FM radio is the weakest part of the device in my experience, probably because it does not have a large antenna the reception of many stations has a lot of static.  FM tuner can tune  87.0-108.0 MHz, however the radio has no display so you can't see what station you are tuned into.The speaker can be made quite loud.  How to control the volume is not documented in the instructions.  There are 4 buttons on top of the speaker the buttons on the right control the volume as well as perform next/previous function. If you touch and release the buttons quickly it does next/forward, if you press and hold the buttons then you can control the volume (left is volume down, right is volume up).  The left most button changes mode (play from memory, bluetooth, FM radio).  The button which is second from the left performs pause operation as well as answer the phone.To help me make evaluate and compare different speakers I always use the same pieces of music to test the speakers.  This way I can compare the speakers using this \"apples-to-apples\" comparison. As a stress test for the bass I use Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. The second piece of music (Tchaikovsky) does not have a lot bass and allows me to test the mid-range. EasyAcc handled both pieces of music very well. Some speakers cannot handle the bass of the Fugue and break up, but EasyAcc sounded good through out.&#9835; &#9835; &#9835; The speaker weights 8.7 oz.&#9835; &#9835; &#9835; It is 8.5\" long and 2.75\" wide at the widest point.I received this speaker for testing and review from the manufacturer.

Bluetooth speakers always tend to costing a bit more, so right away this speaker has features that many others in the same price range don't.The speaker comes with everything you need to use is, including a 3.5mm cable for using the speaker with your non-Bluetooth devices.  I appreciate that this was included, as some companies (including pricey brand name companies) tend to leave this out, assuming people will buy one if they want to use it. With the cable being included, this broadens the number of devices you can use this speaker with right out of the box, significantly. While I have Bluetooth in my iPhone and my tablet, I don't in my little iPod shuffle, and I love to play music from it.

What I like about bluetooth gifting is that if you are like me, you can enjoy a few of them so it's the kind of gift that is just fine if you already own one but if you don't,  you will wonder why you didn't get one sooner.Great for the bathroom while you get ready for work and always ready when it's time for play after work from doing your prancercise (kidding) to hanging by the pool.Clear and loud sound and nice features.Product provided by EasyAcc.

I have a couple better bluetooth speakers but use this one more often.  I don't even use the bluetooth connection.* How I'm using it: After testing this bluetooth speaker for its full functionality, I am using as a wire-connected external speaker for my Kindle Fire HD.  This Kindle has a sleep function that allows the Kindle to auto-turn off for a selection of time settings.  I like to listen for awhile as I fall asleep and then have it turn off itself.  I've got this wired to my Kindle, even though I could connect with bluetooth.  I'm using the 3.5mm audio cable that came in the box.* With cell phones: I tested it with my cell phones and it worked well in some ways but adds to the small time lag inherent with cell phones.  Pairing was simple using the instructions.  The speaker sound was adequate for me (I'm no audiophile) and the effective range is 10 meters.  But the microphone sound to the other end was POOR because the effective range was probably 1.5 meters.  I like to move around when I'm on the phone so this is useless to me for cell phone conversations.* Radio is serviceable with reasonable sound.I was provided a promotional sample.  This is my honest review.  In my view, the price coupled with volume-weight made this 5-stars despite the lack of long effective microphone range.For longer battery life, be careful to: (1) Fully charge battery before using first time.  (2) Do not use speakers when charging.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "More than adequate for many portable uses", "unixReviewTime": 1385164800, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2013"}

Since I already had a charger base for a USB cable, I just inserted the cable into the base and the unit fully charged up in about 2 hours.**This is my very first Bluetooth Speaker set and I am so very impressed on so many levels! The sound of these speakers is just amazing for many genres of music I play, my podcasts and my audio books, the sound has such richness and depth.+ Pairing - This speaker is very easy to pair with my Tablets and phones and even my MP3 players! So I first paired up all the units so I can use these speakers with any device I choose to.+ Excellent Sound Quality - The treble is excellent and the bass is very good. Though this is a small sized Bluetooth speaker set, I am amazed at the overall richness in sound. The sound will go quite loud if needed and I learned quickly how to adjust the sound on these speakers: To turn down the sound do a long hard press on the back button (the sound shares the button with the back and forward buttons). To increase the sound, do a long hard press of the forward button.**Note that to turn up or down the volume say on your phone or tablet's player, you can also press the volume up in the player to increase the sound. However, I did this first AND then pressed the volume up in the Bluetooth Speaker.+ Other Uses For This Bluetooth Speaker Set:1) Plug in a flash drive and play MP3 songs from there. What is does is make the Flash drive like a portable MP3 Player. So I have a favorite extra song Flash Drive (16gb) that I tried out and played all of my music played great. So I have several Flash Drives dedicated to music and podcasts so now, I can use these speakers to play my on the go music from my flash drives!These songs were not in folders, just in a long playlist as each flash drive has a long playlist on it.2) Plug in a SD Card adapter with a micro SD card inserted or you can plug in a standard sized SD card with your favorite MP3 songs on it. So I found a couple of SD cards (1GB and 2GB and copied my favorite music with instrumental and the other favorite songs). So I tried each of these in my EasyAcc CSR Bluetooth Speaker and the sound is superb!3) Portable entertainment center - So I use this with my phone and tablets of course, however, since I have 2 SD cards and 2 flash drives filled with music, I can use this as a stand alone portable stereo.For me, I bring this speaker all around my home: Kitchen, back porch, bedroom on nightstand for easy listening to fall asleep (I use my soft instrumental music with the SD card plugged into this speaker and and plays all night long. In the morning I recharge.This unit is perfect for taking on trips, like in a hotel room, park, beach or wherever you want to enjoy music wirelessly!If you like to travel and love to listen to music on the go (Bluetooth with your device or using your SD card, Flash Drive, look no more, I believe that you will love this EasyAcc Bluetooth Speaker unit!Note: I was supplied the Easy CSR Bluetooth Speakers for testing and evaluation, and agreed to review the item, therefore this is a fair and honest review as I truly am amazed by this product!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bluetooth Speaker With Excellent Sound Quality!

Considering the low price, well this thing is outstanding.Even if a speaker is cheap or beautifully designed, if the sound is nasty, there is nothing worthwhile about that speaker. This little speaker surprised me, the sound was much better than I expected. The sound is actually stereo, yes two speakers that put out real live stereo is a rare thing in teeny portable speakers (even expensive ones). Oh this isn't audiophile sound, at this price point you'd have to be crazy to expect that. But dog gone it, this speaker is easy on my ears. It handles loud volume fairly well - it takes some pretty high volume before this speaker falls apart. There is a little bit of bass, not ground thumping, but clear. The midrange is this speaker's strong suit, lyrics are clear. The highs are not harsh. A darn good speaker.I've seen the chip this speaker uses on a few other Bluetooth speakers - the first clue was FM radio, chip reader, long presses on buttons to change volume, and a few other odd things. This is the best implementation of that chip I've seen yet. Instead of a micro SD reader, they included a full size SD card reader - nice. The buttons are much better than others, with a solid feel. I don't really care about the FM radio, that's just a silly function to add.Design-wise, I'm torn about this; you'll either love it or hate it. The skinny football shape makes it easy to carry and pack in a carryon bag. The speaker grills are metal so they will stand up to abuse, you'd have to work at ruining them. The orange accent around the grill, ah, I don't like that so much. I really dislike the choice to make the EasyAcc logo in bright white paint, but make the buttons a dark gray. It should be the other way around - I have to squint to figure out the buttons. White icons would be much better. When paired over Bluetooth there is a blue light that flashes underneath the floating key block. Ah you know, in the end, if I get tired of listening to the speakers, I can play catch with this.Pairing was easy or exactly like any other Bluetooth device. The speaker shows up as FB Wireless (yeah, that's intuitive). The buttons on top controlled the music on an iPhone 4s.The speakerphone doesn't work very well. Volume had to be turned way up to hear a conversation. The microphone did a good job on the other end. In a pinch this will work. When my phone rang the music muted. Pressing one of the top buttons answered the call and hung up the phone.The battery is an interesting deal. Most of these speakers have an enclosed battery that can't be easily changed without a screwdriver. EasyAcc decided to use a replaceable battery. The only way this is even remotely useful is if you happen to have one of about 30 different ancient Nokia phones. The battery is a BL-5C used in the N-Gage, N91, and 30 other Nokia phones. There were only about 56 million of these phones made, way back in 2007. The chances of you having a functioning phone are slim to none. And hauling around a charger for that battery is even sillier. It is infinitely easier to just plug this into a USB port with the included mini USB plug. The battery cover fit tightly and would take a lot of work to pop off accidentally.Overall, I like this speaker. Stereo is a major bonus, something no speaker at this price point offers. For casual listening, this is a good choice.I was provided a review sample.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stereo!", "unixReviewTime": 1382745600, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2013"}

One of the best I've tested.&#9830; Has a replaceable rechargeable battery that charges with a standard Mini USB cable (included).&#9830; Tons of connection options including Bluetooth, Aux cable (included), SD Card, USB, built-in FM Tuner.&#9830; Integrated controls on top of speaker for pause, play, fast forward, rewind, volume and speakerphone.&#9830; Has a good range, at least 20-25 feet. I had to walk pretty far across my house before it lost connection.&#9830; Frequency and bass response is good for this size speaker, just don't expect booming bass.&#9830; Not the smallest, but fairly compact.&#9830; Decent stereo and surround effects.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a professional looking box with product information on it. Inside the box was the Speaker, an instruction manual, a Mini USB charging cable and a Stereo Aux cable. The top of the speaker had several buttons (a play/pause/speakerphone button, a rewind/down volume button, a fast forward/up volume button and a mode button). The back has ports for charging, USB, SD Card, Aux, Headphones and a power switch.  The bottom has a door for the rechargeable battery that is replaceable.  The speaker is not the smallest bluetooth speaker I have tested, but it looks really nice.  It looks like a long football.  The orange trim was also nice and it had a blue light on the inside of it.&#9830; Installation - I had no problem pairing the speaker to my iPhone 5 on the first try without bothering with the instructions.  Everything went perfectly and reconnecting was automatic. I plugged in the included Mini USB charging cable into the unit and into my computer to give it an initial charge before testing it out.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the speaker was charged, a did a variety of tests to try it out using my iPhone 5.Test #1 (Sound Quality Test) - I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to Michael Bubl&eacute; to Excision Bass Heavy Dubstep (the Destroid album), and it all sounded really amazing to my ears. The best sounding Bluetooth speaker I have tested.  The volume got very loud with some decent bass response. It handled the high volume with no distortion at all with the bass heavy music. It had good bass sounds for a speaker of this size, but not booming bass (this is not a negative because no tiny speaker can produce booming bass). I was really happy with the sound.Test #2 (Sound Performance Test) - After I got past the basic sound quality, I tried out a few more technical tests. I put speaker directly in front of me and started playing a Dolby HD Surround Sound test video. It sounded really great and produced some decent stereo or surround sound effects, even though the speakers were pretty close to each other.  The decent stereo performance was a nice little surprise.  I also played a frequency test file that started at 20Hz and found that the speakers started producing sound around the 45-50Hz range which was pretty low for such a small speaker. The sound continued to get better as the frequency got higher and got pretty painful at the higher frequencies. Very good results for a small speaker.Test #3 (Use Test and Other Features) - I tested Bluetooth range by walking through my house and got about 20-25 feet around some walls before the sound dropped out. Walking back started the sound back up immediately.  Once the sound testing was done via Bluetooth streaming, I tried out the sound and functionality from the other various audio inputs.  The Aux input cable from my iPhone sounded just as good.  I then plugged in an SD Card into the port and the songs on the card started playing immediately.  I was able to control the songs and volume through in integrated buttons with no problem.  I did the same thing with a USB Flash Drive and it worked exactly the same way.  It also had an FM Tuner included with the push of the mode button.  I got some staticky voices to come through, but I really didn't mess with it much.  I was very happy with all of the other inputs.  Quite an impressive variety of options.Conclusion:Overall, I love the sound of this Bluetooth speaker.  It is one of the best I have tried out.  It really sounded great with the variety of music that I tried.  It also has an amazing variety of input options and a replaceable battery.  If you are looking for a great sounding Bluetooth speaker, this one is definitely worth a look.

Chambers", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "I've used a number of Bluetooth speakers, but none of them had the versatility of the EasyAcc CSR speakers. In addition to the Bluetooth connection, the speakers accept input from a 3.5mm audio cable and directly from SD memory cards. There's also a built-in FM radio.I first tried the Bluetooth connection. The speakers paired easily with my Nexus 7 tablet and played music from one of my favorite playlists. Even at maximum volume, the sound clarity with four watts of total output was quite good, and the two speakers are separated enough (about 6&#34;) to give decent stereo. Next I ended the Bluetooth connection and connected the speakers to the tablet with the audio cable. That worked well, and in this hard-wired mode, the volume can be controlled from either the audio source or the CSR speakers.After copying a few MP3 music files to an SDHC memory card, I inserted the card into the slot on the back of the speakers, turned on the speakers, and played music. The music began playing automatically as soon as I turned the power on to the speakers. That's remarkable - I've never seen another set of portable speakers with that capability.There are a number of powerful FM radio stations in our town, so I had no problem bringing in FM stations. I have to say, though, that it's a little clunky looking for favorite stations without a tuner. But the seek function did work pretty well.There's also a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back of the speakers.Another unique feature is the replaceable rechargeable battery in the speakers. It's a Nokia BL-5C Extended Li-Ion battery, and they cost about $5 at Amazon to replace one or to have extra ones charged up to carry with you. The battery can be charged inside the speakers from a DC 5V source and the included charging cable. The user manual doesn't specify the maximum current, but I put it on a DC 5V~1.0A charger for a couple of hours, and it was fine.My only negative comment - and it's a minor one - is that the bottom of the speakers has four little plastic nubs to rest on. A rubberized base would make it more skidproof if it's bumped.With attractive styling, excellent sound quality and volume for its size, the multiple media inputs, and an FM radio, this is perhaps the most versatile portable speakers that I've seen.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the most versatile Bluetooth speakers I've seen", "unixReviewTime": 1382227200, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2013"}

The speaker is obviously a little light on the bass, but given the small size, I was actually surprised by the fullness of the sound.  I put it on a living room shelf and it really filled the room from my iPad which was connected very easily via Bluetooth.The speaker uses a removable battery on the bottom which appears proprietary, so you need to charge it in the speaker itself using the included mini-USB cable.  There is no USB power adapter, so you'll need to have one of those available to charge.  The speaker has a \"mode\" button to allow you to cycle between the various states - bluetooth audio, direct phono plug in, built-in FM radio, or built-in MP3 player.  Obviously there is no display, but the FM radio and mode switching was serviceable and quite usable.The only problem I had was that I copied a bunch of MP3's onto an SD card and while they played, the speaker had a tendency to \"skip\" on the MP3 files.  I don't know why, but the playback just was not smooth on known good files.The result is that I ding the speaker 1 star - I can't recommend it for MP3 playback, but for the low price, it is more than sufficient as a bluetooth speaker.

I will admit up front that I was expecting yet another bluetooth speaker. I actually got much more - and in a sense less - than I expected. I'll get the 'less' part out of the way first. The sound quality is not as good as some of the bluetooth speakers I have tested. However it is not advertized nor pretending to be a high-end speaker. Sound is more than adequate when I am multi-tasking.What made me fall in love is not only does this allow me to connect from my phone and stream music, but also to play from my SD card. I have a few micro SD cards left from other phones when I upgraded card capacity, and they all have a lot of music on them. I had intended to wipe them and give them to a friend, but when I saw the SD card slot I tried it and that was the selling point for me. You do need an SD card adapter to use a micro SD card, which I had. Simply insert it and cycle the mode button to the SD card input and you will be playing music. There are controls that allow you to also skip tracks back or forward and a volume control.  The max capacity claimed for an SD card is 16GB, but mine worked fine with a 32GB card. You can also insert a flash  disk into the provided port.Do note that the micro USB port for powering this speaker is right above the SD card slot and it just barely clears with the included USB cable. I have a different cable with heavier ends that does not fit. This is not a show-stopper, but you should know about it.For bluetooth you press and hold down the mode button until you hear two beeps, when scan from your phone. This speaker will show up as FB Wireless and easily connects. It breaks up about twenty feet from the transmitting device (my phone in my case), but that is on par with some bluetooth receivers that I own.You can also switch this into FM radio mode via the mode button and receive stations in the 87.0 to 108.0 MHz range.It has an internal battery similar to a cell phone type that, according to the documentation, provides three hours of music play time. Of course when attached to the USB power source you can use this indefinitely.There is one final feature: you can directly connect this to any sound source via a 3.5mm cable (also included), so a PC or other device without bluetooth can still play through this speaker.For me this is the perfect companion.

It should be great or near perfect or less distracting if you had a 'second' 12V outlet accessible from the back seats. The way this works is: you plug in the Yubi, you plug the charging wire into the Yubi, you attach your phone or phones and the Yubi charges your phone or phones.Should note that the Yubi people sent me a 'for review' unit and I didn't have to pay for it. I didn't promise a 'good review' either.Let's start with the positives:- Nice looking with a porcelain-like white plastic finish and chrome accents- Ring of power light turns on to show that it's working- Works with both Apple (very well) and Android devices (sort of) but is optimized for Apples.Now, the documentation claims that you have one 2.1A port and one 1A port, sharing 2.1A between them. The manual states that \"the two USB charging ports [...] are specifically designed with DIFFERENT charging capabilities according to the Apple standard\" (the all-caps is mine). The problem is that two 'different' ports are not labeled so there is no easy way to tell the 2.1A port from the 1A port. I emailed the Yubi organization, asking them to clarify.When it comes to Androids, ports that comply with Apple's standard are not as efficient as the specs might indicate. I believe that you will get about 0.5A but if most of the gadgets you're carrying along are Apple then 0.5A for the lonely Android is probably better than nothing. I also asked the Yubi people to comment on this and I will post an update once they respond.The charger gets high marks for the pretty design but loses one star for the ports labeling confusion, which will be addressed soon (see note and explanations below)._________________________________________________UPDATE:An email from the makers of Yubi clarifies some of the issues raised above. Here are the clarifications, only slighted edited.The 2 charging ports are with different current.  The top port is 2.1A and the bottom USB port is 1A. The first edition was not labeled, but the future ones will be labeled and are almost ready.For now, how to know which one is 2.1A and which is 1A, if you lay the car charger with the Logo on top and the specs label on the bottom position. Then the top charging port is 2.1A and the bottom one is 1A.It is not meant that each port has different charging capabilities, it really means that they used different types of charging capabilities but all were used based on Apple's charging method.Android phones will work just as fine as the Apple products, 0.5A is not the most you can get, you can get a full 2.1A or 1.0A depending on which port you use. While most smartphones only take 0.5A even though the port can deliver 1.0A or more. Because the phone only needs 0.5A", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "For Apples all the way, good for Oranges (Androids) too", "unixReviewTime": 1374537600, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2013"}

This is typically my phone and one or more tablets, though more than once I've had a friend along that was in need. The 500mA output on the Scosche isn't great, not giving much of a charge during my 45min-1.5hr commute, especially if was using one of the devices during the trip.  The Soundfly was a bit better, but still only half what I could get from an AC outlet and charger.  And then comes the Yubi Power unit.  The construction is solid, and it has a red LED ring along the outer edge to let you know that it's connected to power.  The red doesn't go with my blue interior lighting, nor the white housing with the rest of my interior, but oh well.  Overall, it looks good and the low profile keeps it from sticking out like a sore thumb.  On to the testing.Out of the gate, the Asus Transformer was not impressed with the Yubi.  The Yubi isn't the first of charger my Transformer refuses to play well with, so I wasn't surprised.  This is due to the Yubi being wired up to match Apple's charging method while the Transformer has it's own ideas, plus it is designed to pull more that 5V to charge.  My guess will be that a Samsung Galaxy Tab will having similar issues. Outside of that device, everything else worked great, both in single an dual charging setups.  I used a 2A wall charger to compare the charge rate on each device, then repeated with the Yubi.  As expected, the difference in rate was nil.  Things got interesting when I started comparing in dual charging mode.  What should happen, according to the secs and details on the Yubi, is that each device should charge at half the rate of a single device (2A/2 devices = 1A per device, or, 10W/2 devices = 5W per device).  What I found however is that in all dual charging scenarios, the devices charged at the same rate as when they were charged by themselves.  To verify that they would charge slower if not given 2A, I tested each with a 1A charger and the Scosche adapater.  Sure enough, there was a significantly lower rate of charge.  So, what does this mean?  The biggest thing is that the Yubi I got was able to charge two devices, at the same time, and at the same rate as if they were plugged into a wall charger.  That's huge for me.  I don't know if I got an extra special unit from Yubi, or if this is the norm, but it was sealed in retail packaging, and I'm quite happy with my new adapter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bring on the power", "unixReviewTime": 1369612800, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2013"}

I often prefer to have a charger that will let me choose the cable rather than having a built in cable that could bend, twist, and break making the whole charger useless.  TheYubi Power YPCC-210B Dual USB Car chargeris great because it offers two charging USB ports and you can use whichever USB cable you need for your specific device.The design of the unit is very sleek.  In a piano black finish, the plug protrudes only about a half an inch from the cigarette lighter socket (this may vary slightly from vehicle to vehicle).  The unit features a red indication glow ring that indicates it is powered and ready to use.  I say glow because, unlike most chargers on the market today with a bright LED light, the red ring light is soft and not distracting, especially during night driving.The unit features 2.1A total capacity.  One port is capable of 2.1A (great for an iPad or other tablet) and the other is rated at 1A (great for most Smartphones).  The limitation of this charger is that if charging a tablet and a phone at the same time, the total output will only be 2.1A; the unit will split that into 1.1A for each charging port.  It's not that big of a deal to me personally because it can still charge, only a little slower.  If you find that you are constantly charging a tablet and phone at the same time while on the road, this may be a consideration.This charger is great for doing double duty on small devices like music players, Smartphones and the like.  It is capable of tackling a tablet such as the iPad with a full charge capacity if only one port is used, if both are in use then the total Amps will be split between the ports as noted above.Overall, despite the minor limitation of splitting the Amps when charging a tablet and phone at the same time, I still think theYubi Power YPCC-210B Dual USB Car chargeris a great charger.

At the time of charging, my phone had 26% left.  Almost 2 hours later it charged all the way up to ~96% and I still had 3 dots on my charger.  This probably could have charged another 2-3 more times.  It's actually quite small but a little on the heavier side compared to a few others that I have.  It's got really smooth edges so it feels nice in your hands.To me, the flash light is a little unnecessary and not really friendly with the button.  I sometimes have to keep pressing it to turn it on and I'm not a fan of it.  There are no instructions included with this so it's kind of frustrating at times to use the flashlight.  However, as a battery it's great.  Easy to use and easy to charge.

One of the benefits of being requested to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.These comparison tests reveal that Sendy power bank works very well with Android devices (particularly the Galaxy Tab which is often the worst performer), but did NOT work with my iPad Mini.The size of the power bank is 4\" x 1.75\" x 0.75\". It weight 4.5 oz on my digital scale. In addition to being a charge it also has a built-in LED light. The light is not very bright, but better than nothing in an emergency situation.My methodology for testing power banks is to charge each mobile device for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charged in that 10 minute period. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10004; Nexus 7 Tablet--------------Charging cable -- AC ............. 1% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10004; Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone--------------------------Charging cable -- AC ............. 4% change in charge in 10 minutesData cable ------ AC ............. 1% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10004; Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7--------------------------Charging cable -- AC ............. 5% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10004; iPad Mini--------------------------iPad Mini cable -- power source not recognized ............. 1% dischage in 10 minutes&#10004; Sansa Clip+ MP3--------------------------When I charge Sansa MP3 with a standard AC charger, the MP3 player goes into charging mode, displaying the charging animated icon. When it is plugged into the Sendy power bank the MP3 continued to play the content. This is a great benefit for MP3 player with built-in battery, this means I charge and listen at the same time and I do not have to wait for the battery to recharge.I am attaching a collage of 4 photos, which can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo:Photo #1 shows everything that came in the package, USB cable with interchangeable tips and a small bag for carrying the power bank.Photo #2 shows the power bank next to Sansa MP3 player for size referencePhoto #3 shows Galaxy Tab with the battery app showing resultsPhoto #4 shows iPad Mini which did not recognize the power shot (when it does a white plug icon is displayed on the app screen)Overall:------------------Excellent performance for Android devices, does not work with iPad Mini.

Providing a whopping 5200mAh worth of power, that's more than enough for refilling most any device out there.  It's also a fair amount to use with just about any USB powered device, like a lamp or light.  Besides capacity, one of the things that can be important is the output rating.  The Power Bank is rated at 5V/1A, which is larger than many last gen phone chargers, but half or so than that of many modern devices.  What does that do?  I'll tell you in a bit.Cosmetically, I thought the Power Bank a pretty good looking device.  Sleek gloss black with silver accents and muted blue LED lights.  The included cable and adapters for various devices gives the Power Bank owner the option to leave their own cables, or, have a spare to keep with the Power Bank.  Sendy got clever by using a power input connection, micro USB, that is also one of it's output adapters.  This puts micro USB adapter and the included cable on double duty, used both for charging the Power Bank and pushing power from it to a device.  The Power Bank's power efficiency is rated at 88%, which is pretty good (88% of the power pulled into the Power Bank is stored there), and the LED flashlight function was a nice touch in my opinion.  The rated storage temp is something one needs to be aware of though.  Only -14-140F max.  In other words, don't leave this in your car during the summer or winter if you live in a harsh climate.Putting it to use ran into a snag for me pretty quickly.  No matter what, the Power Bank would not charge the Asus Transformer.  Setting that one aside, all the other devices had no issues.  Digging through the included User's Guide, there is a note that the the Power Bank is designed to use Apple's charging scheme.  As such, not every device out will be compatible with the Power Bank.  Specifically mentioned is the Samsung Galaxy Tab, for which there is another adapter that Sendy will provide for free if you contact them.  Ok, fair enough.  How about the device charging rate that I mentioned earlier?  On all devices, the Power Bank provided 8-12% charge over the course of an hour.  Compared to the rate of charge when using an AC adapter, which was along the lines of 44-50% per hour, that's a steep difference.  Because of this low charge rate, I decided to check out what would happen if a given device was busy while connected to the Power Bank.  Could the Power Bank keep the device charged under these circumstances?  For this test, each device's screen was on, Pandora running in the background, and a looped YouTube video playing.  The Power Bank was indeed able to keep up, and even give a 1% charge per hour.  Good to know.Remember that special adapter for the Tab that I mentioned?  There is one little problem with that offer.  Nowhere, not in the user's manual, nor on the box, is here any contact info for Sendy.  Even if you don't need that adapter, what happens if you need to do a warranty claim?  Again, no contact info.  Using Google to search for the company website turned up nothing.  My attempts to contact the representative that had first emailed me got no response.  Not cool guys, not cool. At the current price of 10 bones, it's probably worth a risk buy, but I think the problem big enough to take off a couple of stars for.*Update* 5/17/13 After posting this review a couple of days ago, the Sendy rep has contacted me.  They registered a domain (today), and set up a support email account (info@sendypower.com).  Customers can also contact Amazon seller \"Super Deals\" for support.  The rep also let me know that they agreed that contact info missing was an issue and that they are correcting this issue.

With an 88% efficiency rating, the power bank gives me roughly 2.5+ charges on my iPhone 5 or a partial charge (a little over half) on my 3rd generation iPad. (Buyers should know that power banks rated at 5400 mAh -- or any mAh, for that matter -- don't give all that power since some is lost in the charging and power transfer.) This Sendy power bank comes with a short cable, a carrying pouch, and several adapters for various devices. If you have an iPhone 5, you'll have to supply your own lightning cable. It charges using microUSB and outputs power via USB, so that means you can substitute a longer microUSB cable for charging or any USB-ended cable for specific devices not covered in the adapters.My iPhone 5 charges fairly rapidly with this power bank, not as fast as if I had it plugged into an outlet but still not bad. The iPad is a different story since it requires a lot more juice; it takes several hours just to get all the power out of the bank. The Sendy is a 5 V power pack, and iPads, to get the fastest charge, need a 10 V connection. Still, the Sendy works, albeit slowly. If I'm running low on my iPad battery, I can plug in the Sendy, and it keeps me running. If I'm using power-hungry iPad apps, however, the battery level will drop a little, even with the Sendy plugged in. The drain is slower than it would be otherwise, of course. If you're looking primarily for an extra power source for an iPad, I recommend looking at a greater capacity battery and, if you can find one, a faster charge transfer.The build quality of the Sendy seems solid. I like the design of the blue semi-circle of LED lights on its face to show the current power level. Most power banks have some variation on this feature, but I found this to be one of the more attractive displays. The on/off button is located in the center of the semi-circle. This can double as an LED flashlight by double-clicking the power button. Again, this feature is found on different brands of power banks, and it's something that can come in handy in an emergency. (Imagine being in a hotel room when the power goes off.) I wouldn't expect to use the flashlight when camping or other outdoors-at-night activities since the beam isn't all that bright as it travels away from the source.This power bank has found a spot in my briefcase. An external battery is an important tool for the frequent traveler or anyone else who chews through smartphone batteries.

They have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house.  If you are like us, you probably always have something that is low on batteries at all times.  A typical scenario in our house is someone piling the kids in the car to go to the store, or the mall, or out to eat or wherever and grabbing the iPods, only to find them dead.  Noooooooooooooo!  These are the only things that keep us sane!  So that is where a portable charging solution would be great.I was provided a Sendy 5200mAh Power Bank for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.Initial Impression:  The product looks really nice.  It has a silver metal casing on the sides and smooth black plastic on the top and bottom.  It looks and feels very solid and substantial in your hand, but not too heavy.  It has one power button, four blue LEDs that act as a capacity gauge, a micro USB input for charging the Power Bank and a normal USB Output for charging your electronics.  It is very compact and sleek looking.  It also came with a small 9 inch USB cable with several tips that are used for charging the unit and your equipment.  It has a standard Apple 30-pin adapter, but no Lightning adapter (which is typical at this point because Lightning cables are so difficult to reproduce).  I used it with a new AmazonBasics Lightning Cable which worked great.  It also has an LED flashlight which you activate with a double click of the power button.It came with some charge to it so I plugged it in and charged it until it was full.  All four LEDs were lit when it was full.  It only took a few hours to top it off for the initial charge.  After it was full I did some testing with my iPhone 5.I took the fully charged Power Bank and plugged in my mostly depleted iPhone 5 that had only 20% charge remaining.  I got the following readings.Starting Point = 20% ChargeAfter 20 Minutes = 43% ChargeAfter 40 Minutes = 66% ChargeAfter 60 Minutes = 87% ChargeAfter 80 Minutes = 98% ChargeAfter 90 Minutes = Full ChargeOverall, great results.  It was averaging a little better than 1% per minute which seems about right for a 1 Amp charger.  The Power Bank had plenty of juice to fully charge a pretty low iPhone 5 without any problem and the indicator lights still had three LEDs illuminated indicating that it had 50%-75% charge remaining in the power bank.Conclusion:  Overall, the Sendy 5200mAh Power Bank worked great during my initial testing and usage.  I have tested several Power Banks of varying capacities and this one performed as well or better than all of them.  The product is compact and easy to use.  It looks and feels like a high quality piece of equipment.  The flashlight was a nice addition.  It was bright and easy to use.  The current price of $27 is competitive with the other Power Banks of this size that are available on Amazon.  I can see this as an excellent option for a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug.

They were kind of nervous about spending so much money on something they weren't so sure I would like, but WOW did they ever hit the nail on the head with that one.  That iPad has my life on it - my photos, my music, 10,000 books, my recipes, knitting directions, a half dozen full-length movies, games, contact information for everyone I know anywhere, my accounting program, my bank balance - everything.  Where I go, the iPad goes -  and I spend a lot of hours in a car.A full charge on an iPad is good for just about 10 hours of use, so it is not unusual for me to run out of juice halfway home just about the time that the cell phones are all needing a recharge too, so I've been testing several different external battery chargers.  A couple of weeks ago the manufacturer sent me  thisSendy 5200mAh High Capacity Portable Power Backup External Battery Charger with built-in Flashlightto test, and I must say, this is my favorite of the three that I've tested thus far.The unit is quite small and weighs a mere 126 grams (4.4ounces).  It comes with a short cord that has a USB fitting on one end and a variety of connectors (4) that plug in to the other end.  The same cord is used to both charge the device itself and feed power to a device that you wish to charge.  The built-in flashlight is a nice extra bonus that makes it easy to find the plugs that you need in the dark.  The four bright blue LEDs that indicate the charge remaining in the unit are easy to read in any light.While I've tried the device on a variety of cell phones, tablets and ereaders, I have been most interested in how it functions with my iPad and I must say that I am impressed.  Unlike one model I've tested recently, which had an extremely short cord, the charging cord is long enough that I can continue to use my iPad in a normal manner.  The variety of plugs make it possible to carry just one spare charger, which can itself be recharged using either the USB port on a computer or an Apple wall plug adapter.I have deliberately run the iPad battery down to the point that it shuts itself off and then recharged it using theSendy 5200mAh High Capacity Portable Power Backup External Battery Charger with built-in Flashlightseveral times.  Twice I recharged the iPad while allowing it to rest undisturbed.  In both cases the unit delivered 60-65% of a full charge to the iPad, or about 6.5 extra hours of use.  I also recharged it while using the iPad as I normally do, ending up with about a 45% charge over and above what I had used.The unit comes with a small black velvet pouch to hold the unit, the various ends and the cord, with plenty of room left over for the Apple wall charger and the iPad power cable  (which you can also use with theSendy 5200mAh High Capacity Portable Power Backup External Battery Charger with built-in Flashlightinstead of the cord that comes with it should you need a longer cord) making it very convenient to throw into a purse or backpack.One final note - the directions that come with this product are remarkably clear and easy to follow, printed in type that is large enough to see without resorting to your reading glasses.

I travel often for both work and pleasure, and one of the most problematic things about traveling is keeping powered on the go. I have bought and own several power banks sold here on Amazon and some I have picked up in brick and mortar stores, but I really like theSendy 5200mAh High Capacity Portable Power Banka lot.  It makes the best use of features, unit size, and power capacity.This is what makes the Sendy Power Bank so great:+Lightweight- unit weighs less than 5 oz (138g), great for tossing in any day bag or purse.+Sleek operation- unit is very responsive with two presses of the power button to turn the light on, and two presses to turn the light off, a press to turn the unit on for charging and a press to turn it off when finished.+One feature found on this unit, which is not common to find on most power banks, is that the charging port is automatic. This allows the unit to turn on, beginning a charge the moment you plug any device into it, and it will auto-shut off (after 10 seconds) when you unplug your device. It's an amazing feature that saves you time in both turning the unit on and off. The unit also features an LED display that indicates the charge level by how many of the 4 blue LEDS are illuminated.+An LED [Flash]Light- Work, play, or travel, there are so great uses for a flashlight, weather on a dark plane, in a dark car, or inspecting your hotel room for cleanliness, this is a great addition for such a small sized unit.  The light is bright and powerful.+Recharges with a Micro-USB cable- No longer will I need to carry a specialty cable/charger to recharge my power bank, I can use the same cable I use for my Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HD to recharge this unit.  You can recharge the unit with the included cable via computer, or use a wall charger like the one that came with your tablet or cellphone; manufacturer suggests ensuring the output of the charger you would use is at least 500mA and 5V DC.In the package you will find: the Sendy 5200mAh power bank, a soft drawstring carrying case (great addition, not often included with similar power banks), an 8\" USB charging cable that works with the 4 (four) included tips (Mini USB, Micro USB, Apple (30-pin), and PSP)Being an `on-the-go' person, I like to have options when recharging my phone, tablet, digital camera, etc.; this is perfect for those purposes. Even for use with a Kindle Fire or Nexus 7, this power bank can get close to, if not a full charge for these devices.A primary consideration when looking to buy a power bank is the mAh the unit can hold, essentially, how much of a charge the power bank can hold total and provide to devices being charged. This unit has a single USB 1amp port with a 5,200 mAh capacity. When considering this unit, if getting a full charge for your device is important, think of this power bank as great for use with cellphones, and most Android tablets. This unit will add hours of life to your iPad, but it does not have the capacity for a full charge.Overall, theSendy 5200mAh High Capacity Portable Power Bankis perfect for the applicable uses. This is not just a burst of power, but provides full charges, and adds hours of life to your devices; important when getting to an outlet is just not feasible.

Hotels, in particular, are stingy with open outlets.  This Bolse high output charger solves part of this problem by having two USB ports, a 1.0 A port and a 2.1 A port for more power-hungry devices.  This means that I can charge my iPhone and my iPad out of the same outlet plug and at the same time.  Because the plug is not polarized, I can plug in one of these with the ports pointing down and another with them pointing up to enable charging four devices out of a standard two-plug outlet: iPhone, iPad, camera, and Kindle, for example.The prongs fold into the body for a sleek travel shape; however, the moveable prongs also mean that sometimes I fold the prongs into the body when I'm trying to plug them into an outlet.  Not a big deal for me.  The body is a glossy white or a glossy black plastic and feels extremely sturdy.  It handles 100-240 volts AC current, so it can be used in many different countries as long as I have a travel adapter. (No power converter necessary, only the adapter.)

The charger measures 2 6/8\" long by 1 1/4\" wide by 1 1/4\" deep (without prongs extended), making it extremely portable.This device is a must-have for frequent travelers like me; however, it is also useful in the home or to take to the office.

With the charger I brought it didn't matter because the ports faced outward whether it was plugged into the top or bottom. But with this charger my ports would have been facing the floor. Just not as convenient. Of course I could have switched the opening where the digital radio was plugged in, but then I would have had to reset it (been there, done that)Everyone's needs are different, so the port location on the bottom may not matter to you, but for me means that this is not a charger that I will bring when I travel.

The tablet was down to 62% and the phone was down to 60%. Both showed 100 percent when I unplugged them from the charger four and a half hours later.

What I did was this: I plugged in the iClever dual charger in the bottom socket and on the top socket, I placed a HTC charger (it is not wide).

One of the benefits of being requested to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.  They can also help to do comparison shopping when selecting a power pack that works best your device.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; Key finding:======================&#10004; I found that this power pack worked much better with  my Samsung Galaxy tablet than it did with iPad Mini.&#10152; General features:======================Bolse AON5 11000mAh external battery weighs 10.1  oz, the power supplies weights 3.4 oz.

My first impressions on the AON 5 is that it is pretty big; however, it would be great to carry around in a backpack or a purse. Included with the AON 5 are multiple adapters for various phones and devices, some of the more popular ones include the Micro USB adapter, Mini USB adapter, and the Apple 30 pin adapter. You are not limited to the charging adapters that are included, as long as you already have a charging cable for your device and it charges Via a USB port than this battery pack should be able to charge it. Along with the adapters that are included you will also receive the instruction manual and a carrying bag for the unit its self or the adapters. What is really neat about this battery pack is the fact that it can charge 5 devices simultaneously! Each one of these different USB ports offer a different output:*USB Port 01: Samsung DC at 1.3 Amps*USB Port 02: iPad DC at 2.1 Amps*USB Port 03: iPad/iPhone at 1 Amp*USB Port 04: iPad/iPhone at 1 Amp*USB Port 05: Universal at 0.5 AmpsThe battery pack its self is very stylish and looks amazing, it is kind of on the big side, but isn't really heavy. The black material that you can see in the pictures do attract a lot of finger prints, but this isn't much of an issue to me. Offering a battery size of 11,000 mAh it offers a lot of battery and thus can charge most smartphones multiple times. Most smartphones have batteries between 1000-2000 mAh, some have bigger batteries, but as you can see this battery pack can charge these devices multiple times and still have left over battery. You can tell how much of a charge the battery pack still has by the 5 LED lights that it has, each blue light represents 20%, so if one light is lit then the battery pack has 1-20% of a charge left, 2 lights lit means that it has 20-40% of a charge, 3 lights it means 40-60%, 4 lights means 60-80% and 5 lights lit means 80-100% of the charge remaining. This battery pack is great for travel with the family or just for a single individual that might have multiple devices or simply wants it for its large battery size. Having one of these battery packs is a smart choice in our world today as many people now have phones/tablets that are constantly draining battery life and are power hungry. Having a portable battery pack eliminates the need of worrying that your device is going to run out of battery no matter where you are since you don't need to be connected to a power outlet in order to charge your devices.Overall I haven't experienced any difficulties or issues with the AON 5 and I rate it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars!I hope this review helped you out!I was provided a sample product for testing and evaluation, my review of this product is honest and are my own words.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful Charging Capabilities!", "unixReviewTime": 1371686400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2013"}

You can choose from a DC 9-12V/ 1A input port that plugs into your wall socket or a Micro to USB 5V 1A-1.5A that charges from you PC.  The DC charger is the faster of the two.  Please read the specifications on the main page to see how many devices this cool battery can charge! There is also a nice black pouch that will keep the battery and all the attachments safe and together.Just some geek info: \"mAh\" means `Milli-ampere hour'. It's the rating of the battery. It means your battery is of 11,000 mAh rating. It allows you talk time of `about' 175 minutes and stand by time of `about' 150 hours.The power bank charges by the Micro to USB or the DC input port on the right side of the battery).  Charging through the Micro to USB port will take about 10 hours to charge and using the DC charger will take about 8-9 hours to charge.  So overnight charging will keep you powered for a long time. There are also FIVE USB inputs on the bottom side.  These are all the standard 5 V, but each one has a different output in Amps. These range from:*USB 1: 5V / 1.3A (MAX) - For Samsung Devices*USB 2: 5V / 2.1A (MAX) - For Apple iPad, PSP, HP Touchpad, Amazon Kindle*USB 3: 5V / 1A (MAX) - For iPhones, iPods, Nexus, Android, Blackberry, All other Smartphones*USB 4: 5V / 1A (MAX) - For iPhones, iPods, Nexus, Android, Blackberry, All other Smartphones*USB 5: 5V / 0.5A (MAX) - For all other Mobile Phones.0.5A (Max)I have an iPhone 4S and it will charge an easy five full times. It charged my iPad mini and my iPhone 4S together in about (7.5) hours from a starting point of 20% full. (Never let your device go below 10% in order to keep the battery capacity at its best).I would suggest charging one device at a time to be sure of a full charge in a faster time. The black color is attractive, but shows smudges, if that really bothers you. All attachments are also black. I would suggest looking at all Bolse battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler.  Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. I am a recharge junkie, so I love this model and the 11,200 mAh model.  Please note that all Bolse batteries are different in power, function and capabilities.

I get asked to review them all the time. Bolse has raised the bar this time around with a 11000mAh battery pack that has 5, count-em, 5 USB ports which can all be used simultaneously if desired to charge and power your various devices.As I write this review, I've got my iPhone4, wireless bluetooth headphones, headset for my cell phone, Nexus 7 and an iPad 3 all hooked up to the power bank while it is also being charged from the included AC charger. It's remarkable.There are several different charging rates for the USB ports:USB 1: 5V/1.3AUSB 2: 5V/2.1AUSB 3: 5V/1AUSB 4: 5V/1AUSB 5: 5V/0.5AThere is also an included AC charger to charge the AON5. A nice feature of the AC charger is that the AC plug is removable from the charger. This is good because when traveling, you can remove the plug which prevents it from snagging on something while packed away.While charging the 5 LED lights on the  front face of the AON5 blink sequentially to indicate charging is taking place. When not hooked up to the charger, those same LEDs will inicate the level of charge in the battery pack as shown below:1 LED  on = 1%-20% charge2 LEDs on = 21%-40% charge3 LEDs on =  41%-60% charge4 LEDs on = 61%-80% charge5 LEDs on = 81%-100% chargeThe battery pack can also be charged by USB and uses a microUSB port on the batterypack to plug a USB cable into.Specifications:Capacity: 11000mAhInput: MicroUSB 5V 1A-1.5A, DC 9-12V/1AOutput:USB 1: 5V/1.3AUSB 2: 5V/2.1AUSB 3: 5V/1AUSB 4: 5V/1AUSB 5: 5V/0.5ACycles: 500+Charging Time: 9-10 hours10 connectors of various types are included with the AON5, or you can use the USB cable that came with your device., All the popular plug tips are included including an Apple 30-pin connector, MicroUSB, MiniUSB.For the size, this is an amazing power bank.

The question is, will it really charge five devices at once?  The answer is, maybe.  In the end, I did not find a combination of five products it could charge before stressing it so much, it would turn off.  Right now, it is charging my iPhone, a small Bluetooth speaker, a 9-inch tablet, and a Kindle 3G.  Four appears to be its limit, but it seems to support fewer or more depending on what type of devices they are.  If I add a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet to the mix, it will only charge three devices.This is a higher capacity power bank, which makes it good for tablets.  Charging just the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet alone, I can give it about an 85% charge (the Kindle had a low battery status, it was not completely drained).The power bank comes with a pouch and different adapters:* 30-pin for iPhones* micro USB* mini USB* Nokia* Sony Ericsson* LG* NDS* Samsung* MotorolaIt can charge via an included wall adapter or micro USB to USB cable.I would really love this power bank if it could truly charge five devices at once.  I'm sure if I found the right combination, it would do it.  I just haven't found it yet.  Even with four, it drains quickly and won't fully charge them all.  We have to be realistic there.  I wouldn't expect an 11000 mAh power bank to fully charge that many products at once, but I do expect it to partially charge them.  Why?  Because it's there.

I really like the convenience of having it but I can't complain considering how much more you can charge.I was able to charge my Olympus camera along with my Samsung note 2.  The charge speed was quite fast and comparable to the AON series 2, 3 and 5. So I can't complain about it. I've tested all of these AON chargers and the 2 and 4 are probably my favorites.

One of the benefits of being requested to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.  They can also help to do comparison shopping when selecting a power pack that works best your device.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charged in that 10 minute period. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; Key finding:======================&#10004; I found that this power pack worked much better with  my Samsung Galaxy tablet than it did with iPad Mini.&#10004; If your laptop takes a large power plug (3/8\") there is no tip to fit it.&#10152; General features:======================Bolse AON4 10000mAh external battery weighs 10.9  oz.

Neither my iPad Mini nor Samsung Galaxy had a connector that fit and I use my own charging cords.None of the laptop tips fit either of our two laptops, which require a larger diameter plug (3/8\"). So I was not able to test how this external battery works with them.  Note that I have tested other external battery packs aimed at laptops that did include the large tip, for example Intocircuit Power CastleIntocircuit Power Castle Series.The package also includes a 7\" coiled charging cable, which can be stretched up to 18 inches. The charging cable for laptops is 28 inches. The package also include AC wall charger which has a cord that measures 51 inches.  AC adapter  has both UL and EC seals (means it passed both US and European certification). It is rated for inputs 100-240V which means it could be used when you travel abroad.It comes with a nice nylon carrying pouch, which fits the battery and tips.  However it does not fit the AC adapter. It would be nice if everything could be kept together in one carrying bag.The unit has a switch for 9V and 12V, this switch has no effect on charging tablets as the tablet regulates how much power it needs.  I tested with the switch in both positions to verify and compare.This power pack looks good - slick black package with pretty blue LEDs indicating the charge level of the external battery.

One of the things I like the best about the new Bolse line of battery packs is the fact that many of them come with everything you could possibly need from tablet and phone plugs, an AC adapter to a nice pouch to carry what you need.  The whole package deal is great for the on-the-go person.  Mind you, most of the battery packs I have came fully functional, but I was always scrambling to find something to test it with.  Usually I ended up plugging the battery pack into my PC overnight, but the AC adapter was much appreciated.And so, how does the Bolse AON4 perform?  Very well.  Quite well actually.  Mind you, it's a given that you can readily charge a couple of smaller devices at the same time given this is a 10000mAh battery pack, but I wanted to see how it would perform with a seriously depleted iPad battery.  I made sure the AON4 was fully charged and then put it to work on my iPad that was only 33% charged.

When you first open the box inside are:1) the power bank it's self2) An instruction manual3) A carrying bag for either the power bank, or all of it's included accessories4) Multiple device adapters for many different kinds of phones, some of the more common are the Apple 30 pin connector, a micro USB adapter, and a Mini USB adapter5) Also included is the charger for the unit it's self which connects to a wall outlet, for faster charging than other Power Banks.6) Multiple adapters to charge many different types of \"large\" devices such as laptops, cameras, etc.The AON 4 is one of the only power banks that I have seen to be able to charge devices such as laptops, this is available because the unit offers 3 power outputs. The two USB ports charge at 5V, 2.1 Amps, which is definitely a good power output and it charges your devices faster. These USB outputs can both be used at the same time simultaneously. As for the charging of laptops, not all laptops can be charged, make sure the adapter for yours is included otherwise if you are purchasing this unit specifically for charging you might not be able to charge it. If it is supported, there are the options to charge at 9 Volts or at 12 Volts. On the device, there are blue light indicators that represent how much battery is left in the power bank. One light on represents 1-25% battery, 2 lights represents 25-50%, 3 lights represents 50-75%, and 4 lights indicate that the unit has 75-100% of its battery left. At 10,000 mAh you don't need to worry that much about the power bank's battery unless you are charging devices with large batteries such as the iPad 3 which has a 10 hour battery. This unit won't be able to bring back an dead iPad 3 to 100%, but it will restore it to about 70-80% battery levels. It will definitely charge Smartphones multiple times, most smartphones have batteries that are relatively small (1000-2000 mAh). The unit it's self looks very nice, the front of the power bank does seem to attract and gain a lot of fingerprints because of the material. Overall this power bank is one of the best that I have used and it offers a lot with charging outputs of 9V and 12V. This is an essential product to have if you are a user of smartphones or tablets which are constantly consuming battery life. This removes the need to be near a wall outlet to charge your devices and gives you the freedom to charge a device anywhere you are whether it's at school or at work or any other place where you would normally not have access to a wall outlet.

Phones, iDevices, tablets and so on; the recharging options are endless.Recharging with this unit is simple.  Using the included MicroB tip and the coil cable, this battery charged my Nexus 7 in sleep mode from 25% to 100% in about 2 hours. I still had over 50% power left in the AON4 battery after doing this. Most of the smaller capacity batteries I have tried would have no power left after tackling such a feat.The value this battery pack provides is with the accessories that are included. In the package you will find a coil USB cable with 10 different tips that can be used with different phones and tablets; a DC power wire with 6 different tips for use with a variety of computers and netbooks; an AC wall charger, and a mesh pouch for storage. This is perfect for those who want peace of mind in knowing they don't have to go searching for a cable to charge their device. .This external battery has two USB ports, a DC output and an AC input, for charging the external battery. The two USB outlets are designed independently to accommodate specific Apple and Android device charging requirements. One outlet is designed with circuit's custom to Apple devices and the other is designed to work specifically with the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Both ports support most all 5V/2.1A devices. The USB outlets can be used to charge either/or, however it will take longer to charge an Apple device if you use the outlet not specifically designed for Apple products.

To charge your 9V or 12V device, use the included DC power cable, the laptop connector that corresponds with your device, press the on/off button, slide the voltage selector to the appropriate output voltage (either 9V or 12V) and begin charging. (I wasn't able to test this feature)It's important to unplug the power cable promptly when the device is fully charged.The Bolse AON4 10000mAh battery pack comes with an AC adapter, USB spring power cable, DC power cable, travel pouch, 6 laptop connectors, an instruction manual & 10 mobile phone connectors (to see the included connectors, hover your cursor over Amazon's image at the top of this page.

This is one of the more powerful battery packs storing 10,000 mAh. First the battery pack is about one pound and measures 5\" X 3\" X 1\". The button on the surface displays four bright-blue LED lights - each about \" circles.  This shows you 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of charged power.  There are (10) ten specific attachments for most smartphones.  There are also (6) six differently sized `tablet connectors'.  All have the same male plug on one end and six different color-coded male plugs on the cover.  Bolse seems to have covered all bases with these attachments.There are also two ways to charge your External Battery.  You can choose from a DC 9-12V/ 1A input port that plugs into your wall socket or a Micro to USB 5V 1A-1.5A that charges from you PC.  Both are adaptable with one of the (6) six male tablet connectors.  The DC charger is the faster of the two.  Please read the specifications on the main page to see how many devices this cool battery can charge! There is also a nice black pouch that will keep the battery and all the attachments safe and together.  It's a real necessity.There is a switch on the side that allows you to switch from (9) volts to (12) volts, depending on your device to be charged.  The female Output port serves (9) volt and (12) volt devise such as laptops, cameras, camcorders, tablets and more.  The female Input port charges the Bolse external battery.  There are also two out USB ports on the same side.  USB Output port `S' serves all 5V/2.1A input devices with designed circuitry specifically for the Samsung Galaxy Tablet.  The Output port `'I' serves all 5V/2.1A with a designed circuitry specifically for Apple devices.Just some geek info: \"mAh\" means `Milli-ampere hour'. It's the rating of the battery. It means your battery is of 11,000 mAh rating. It allows you talk time of `about' 160 minutes and stand by time of `about' 135 hours.  Charging through the Micro to USB port will take about 9 hours to charge and using the DC charger will take about 7-8 hours to charge.  So overnight charging will keep you powered for a long time.I have an iPhone 4S and it will charge five full times. It charged my iPad mini and my iPhone 4S together in about (8.5) hours from a starting point of 20% full. (Never let your device go below 10% in order to keep the battery capacity at its best).I would suggest charging one device at a time to be sure of a full charge in a faster time. The black color with the almost mirrored surface is attractive, but shows smudges, if that really bothers you.  All attachments are also black, except the (6) six differently sized `tablet connectors' which are color-coded nicely.I would suggest looking at all Bolse battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler.  Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. I am a recharge junkie, so I love this model and the 11,200 mAh model.  Please note that all Bolse batteries are different in power, function and capabilities.

I have used the ECOXBT in all types of settings - from the beach, to travel, and as a general household bluetooth speaker. The ECOROX is the smaller cousin to the ECOXBT, and in many areas it is its equal but in terms of overall sound quality it falls just a bit short.The main attraction of the ECOROX (and the ECOXBT) is that it is FULLY waterproof (not just water resistant). In fact the ECOROX not only floats, but it can also withstand being completely submerged. This means that you can take on a hike, camping, to the beach, or even boating without fear of damaging the speaker. In many ways it looks like and sounds like Braven BR1 Speaker, but the ECOROX has a higher degree of water resistance than the BRV 1.Notes-- Features two 3 Watt speakers - this deliver impressive sound, which (in my opinion) is not quite up to the level of the ECOXBT it is comparable to the Braven BRV 1 (which is at a higher price point).- The sound quality is better than what you would expect - it is very comparable to the Braven BRV 1. The sound performance is solid until you get to the low end of sound spectrum. Deep bass at higher volumes causes the ECOROX to begin to bottom out and sound a bit muffled.- Roughly half the size and weight of the ECOXBT - making it much more portable. The ECOROX will easily fit in a backpack.- Works as a speakerphone- Easy to pair with any bluetooth device- Volume controls and speakerphone options are located on the top of the speaker- The speaker charges in the back by pulling our a small plug that is used to waterproof the device. Under the plug is also where you will find the auxiliary input for non-bluetooth speakers.Final Verdict - The ECOROX buetooth speaker may become my new go-to bluetooth speaker. It is fully waterproof and also decent sound for the package.

Like its larger cousin, the ECOXBT, the ECOROX is a completely waterproof Bluetooth speaker that can go anywhere -- the beach, the pool, the shower, or on a hiking trip. Once you charge it fully, the battery will last for 9-10 hours of music: if you take an external power bank with you to recharge it, you could probably get several days worth of playing without have to plug it into an outlet. The size (roughly 5\" x 3\" x2.5\") makes it the perfect size to stash in a backpack or beach bag. I love that I can keep my iPhone or iPad a safe distance from water and still have sound coming through the speaker right next to water. Even better, I can play music through my iMac and carrying the speaker outside. The Bluetooth range, while not as extensive as a speaker run through a wireless network, is better than average. The volume is powerful. The sound is good, not great, but still much better than might be expected from a small waterproof speaker.When I'm connected via my iPhone, I can answer an incoming call using the call button, just as I could with a Bluetooth headset. I cannot start a call, however, and I cannot call up Siri. Button on the top of the speaker allow me to skip to the next track and adjust the volume. It's a little annoying to hear the high-pitched beeps when the speaker is making its Bluetooth connection, and there's a static click when I stop the music for longer than ten seconds.To keep the unit waterproof, you must take care that the back rubber panel is completely flush with the unit. I could tell from the moment I opened the box that this a rugged speaker. The rubberized ridge on the side make it easy to grip and offer impact protection if you drop it. The grilles (the colored parts) are thick, rigid, and dent-resistant. The rubberized controls have a nice feel.The unit charges through an included microUSB to USB cable. The manufacturer also included a carabiner clip to hook it to a backpack or other handle. A threaded-screw mount on the bottom enables attachment to a speaker stand, tripod, or anything else with a universal mounting screw. I have the red model, and I like that it's a dark red, not too bright but colorful enough to find easily in a bag.As a portable, weatherproof, waterproof speaker, this ECOROX excels.

One of the advantages the ECOROX has over the ECOXBT is the simple fact that it's smaller and more portable than its counterpart.  The carbiner makes it easy to attach to a backpack or secure it to a kayak so it won't go overboard.  Both units are my idea of the type of speaker the outdoorsman would prefer.  In fact, the ECOROX is perfect for outdoor use.I charged it overnight and the next day got ready to roll.  It paired readily with my tablet and I then tried it with a variety of music to test its capability.  The ECOROX has 6W stereo speakers and does have that power and volume without distortion.  The range is very good, but I did experience some cutting out which didn't appear to be out of line.  I chalked it up to electromacnetic interference in the area.  A little moving around did the trick.  Keep in mind that I was also streaming from a tablet more than twenty feet away.Keep in mind that although the ECOROX is waterproof, that doesn't mean it can be used underwater.  It's simply a way to protect it speaker in extreme circumstances.  I'm sure my unit will receive a couple of dunkings.  The short video clip I did shows that it can be used in damp or wet settings without issue.  In addition to being waterproof it also has a \"Shock Resistant Design.\"  That was obvious from the start and simply holding it my hand told me it was a rugged little unit.Customer service.  I'm a big one on how well it goes.  The first radio I received was what I call a \"dud.\"  Grace Digital excels in the customer service department.  My first ECOROX had trouble holding a charge.

Now Grace Digital is back with the ECOROX wireless Bluetooth speaker. It's roughly half the size of the previous speaker (and weighs 11 ounces vs. 24 ounces), and the manufacturer claims that it's completely waterproof in up to three feet of water. I didn't test the watertightness, but I did put the ECOROX through its paces with two tablets: a Nexus 7 and a Kindle Fire HD 7\". The audio quality is remarkably good for a unit this small, even more so considering that the speakers are waterproofed. The two front-mounted stereo speakers pump out six watts of clean sound, which blends with a top-mounted bass speaker to produce music with a richness that belies the ECOROX's small size.Connecting and pairing the Bluetooth was very simple and only took a few seconds for each tablet. The ECOROX was able to control the volume of the sound (the volume control in the tablet works also), and the ECOROX controls would advance to the next song on a playlist or return to the previous song. In other words, keep the ECOROX within reach and control your music with it, while your tablet or smartphone can be up to 30+ feet away. I also hardwired the ECOROX to the tablet, and that worked fine (note that the waterproof seal must be open to access the 3.5mm jack, so you lose watertightness while it's hardwired). By the way, my primary interest in the ECOROX is for music, but the great sound quality makes gaming a whole new experience.I seldom use my smartphone as a telephone, so I didn't try the hands-free call feature, but I can definitely see the ECOROX being used with my phone's GPS to amplify the voice directions over the road noise.The ECOROX does not include an AC charger, but the user guide indicates that one can be used instead of recharging from a PC's USB port.

It's a solid and durable enclosure... not a sort-of, wannabe tough, but a real solid tough. It's also completely waterproof achieveing both IPX7 and IPX8 ratings (Google it.) Bottom line is that this can go underwater and won't be phased, as long as the port covers are closed properly.Speaking of ports, there is a Micro USB charging port and a 3.5mm Aux in port, both in the same, rubber seal covered area on the bottom of the speaker. The thing charges in just 2.5 hours and will play for at least 10 hours.

This thing cranks out 3W RMS per channel with a 125 Hz to 18000 KHz frequency range. That means it gets pretty loud and sounds good doing it.

It puts out a lot of sound for something that's only 5 inches long. At maximum volume, I could hear it loud and clear from the other rooms in the house. The connection is good, I like the bass, there's no static, and it's not tinny. I could actually use it for a party.It could be used anywhere, really. Like its larger cousin, the ECOXGEAR ECOXBT, it looks like it could survive being run over by a truck -- perfect for the rugged outdoors. It even comes with a carabiner, to hang on a hook or backpack.The ECOXGEAR can also be mounted, but you'll have to provide your own mount. It can fit on all of my tripods. When I want it to look cute next to the hot tub, I put it on a mini tripod and adjust. It will work on any mount that will hold a standard camera.The speaker is waterproof, meaning it can fall into the water and survive. It's not meant to play submerged (not good at all, don't try). Actually, the speaker floats. I put it in the pool and the hot tub and I can vouch that it still plays after those ordeals. I even use it in the shower, where it works perfectly.Lastly, there is a phone function. When calls come in through my phone, I can answer it. I tested it with my son, both from the speaker end and the phone end. The sound through the speaker is good. It picks up everything. The problem is the other end, where it's touch and go. The sound is sometimes good, sometimes difficult to hear.I like the ECOROX because it's small and portable and packs a punch with the sound. It's the best Bluetooth speaker of its size that I've ever owned.This product was provided for review by Grace Digital.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Big Sound In a Small Package", "unixReviewTime": 1371168000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2013"}

The ECOROX can function either via Bluetooth, or hard wire connected, using a standard 1/8\" audio input cord.Looking at the photos, you may not appreciate how small the ECOROX really is, as the dimensions are approximately 2.5\" high, 5\" wide, and 3\" deep.  With a rugged housing, with mostly rubber trim, this unit is designed to be taken with you wherever to go.  The speakers are supposed to be submersible and float on water, however I did not verify this, but exposure to a little rain, shouldn't be an issue.Beneath a rubber strip on the back of the unit, is a mini-USB port for charging, and the audio line in jack.  A mini-USB cord is included, as is a carabiner clip, which can be attached to a swiveling nylon loop on the back of the unit.  The speakers also have a 1/4\" female screw fitting on the bottom, so it can be attached to a tripod or stand.Assessment of sound quality is a very subjective matter, but for speakers with a total output of 6 watts, the performance is pretty sweet, as the unit can produce reasonably high volume, without excessive distortion.  The ECOROX isn't intended to be used to provide entertainment at a party, and the larger ECOXBT is capable of much higher volume, but the ECOROX is fine for casual use.  It works well for either voice or mid-range music, however as is to be expected for speakers of this size, there may be some issues with music with heavy, or intense bass levels.The rubber sealed control buttons are well laid out, convenient to operate, and have a positive click feature.  There are also tiny colored indicator lights, for various functions.  Once your Bluetooth device and the speakers are synched up, connection usually takes a few seconds at the most.  When connected via Bluetooth to your phone, the speakers can also be used to have a conversation.  You simply hit a button, and talk into the speakers, which will transmit your voice.When connected via Bluetooth, the volume can be controlled via your device, or by using the volume control buttons on the unit.  You can also use the ECOXBT with an iPod, or other MP3 player, by connecting via the aux in jack.  When hardwire connected, the volume buttons on the speakers do not work, so you will need to adjust the volume using the controls on your MP3 player.The unit is powered by a lithium ion battery, which can run the unit for about 10 hours.  There are no provisions for AC power, but the unit can operate while connected to USB power.  The ECOROX is available in different color schemes, and can receive signals up to about 30 feet away, however there has to be a clear unobstructed path (line of sight) between the two devices.  If there are walls or other obstacles in the way, you may experience reception problems.If you listen to music, play games, or browse the internet via your smart phone, these speakers could enhance the experience.  Targeted at those with a more active lifestyle, the ECOROX and ECOXBT speakers, cost a bit more than some low end models.  Those into hiking, camping, boating, water sports, or the outdoors, might want to consider the ECOROX, which is very handy, and doesn't take up too much space.The folks at Grace Digital graciously provided this item to me for review purposes.  They also manufacture amounting bracket, so the speakers can be conveniently mounted to your bicycle handlebars using the fitting on the bottom.  I'm not sure that this is something I would do, however I plan to buy one of these brackets, so I can mount a camera to my bike and shoot movies.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "the ECOROX is a compact and relatively powerful bluetooth speaker system...", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2013"}

My Jeep has two cigarette lighters in the front dash, but even that is not enough, especially when there are two people trying to charge cell phones, GPS systems and MP3 players.=== The Good Stuff ===* The dual USB ports is a nice feature. It lets me keep two cell phone chargers \"live\" at all times, a great convenience. I have never had any issues charging two iPhones simultaneously with this adapter.* The \"nose\" of the device is long enough that it fits all the way into the lighter, with about an inch and a half sticking out. That works great for me, because my lighters are mounted very low on the dash, so they don't get bumped. If your lighters are more in the line of dashboard traffic (like near the radio), this stickout length might be problematic.* The device seems reasonably well made, and is made of smooth white plastic with no rough edges. I have been using it for a couple weeks, and have had no problems with it.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* One port is a high-current (2.1A) port, the other is rated for a lower (1.0A) current. The 2.1 was enough to charge my iPad, something I seldom do in the car. I did not try to charge both an iPad and a phone, but I was able to charge two iPhones at the same time with no problems. The only problem is that the labeling on the two ports is quite small-no way you could read it from the drivers seat unless you are part Eagle. If you do plan on regularly charging a high-current device, you will need to mark the port somehow.=== Summary===All things considered, a handy little device that does what is claims to do. It seems well made, and has shown no problems so far. My dash is black, so I would have preferred a different color, but not really a big deal to me.Disclaimer: I received this sample as a sample direct from the manufacturer for review.

There are small engraved markings to indicate which port is capable of doing 2A, but it's not easy to read from a distance.

I only received the car charger.  It is a clean white car charger with a blue company logo on the top and two USB ports on the front.  The two USB ports are very faintly marked as a 1.0A port and a 2.1A port, but share the 2.1A total capacity. It also has an LED power indicator light on the front. It looks nice and small and it appears to have a very nice build quality.&#9830; Installation - As with any car charger, you basically just plug the unit into you car's charging outlet. It had a nice, tight fit and easily maintained the connection to the charging outlet.  It only stuck out about an inch and a half.  The white color matched my Apple Lightning cable, but just make sure the white color works for you.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once installed, I did some basic tests to see how the Etronic car charger handles various charging situations. During my work commute, I took my iPhone 5 that had 30% charge remaining and I did a stand alone test using both ports for 10 minutes each. Both ports increased the charge on my phone by 10% in ten minutes or 1% per minute. I was even streaming music to my car and received a call during charging, so charging performance was very good.  I then tried out the charging of my iPad 2 in the 2.1A port that is built for tablet type devices and the iPad indicated immediately that it was able to charge with the Etronic car charger and had no problem charging up. When charging both devices, it wasn't as fast as some 3.1A total output dual USB car chargers because it shares the 2.1A total capacity, but it did a fine job for the low price.Conclusion:Overall, this is a nice 2.1A Dual USB Car Charger. It is pretty small and has a nice quality build. The unit looks great and performs very well. If you are looking for a reasonably priced dual port USB car charger that has fast stand-alone charging speeds and works well with an iPad, this charger is worth consideration.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2013"}

Most of these devices do not include car chargers, so there's a big market for these chargers. The Etonic charger is a typical example of a dual port car charger, with its two charging ports providing a maximum 2.1 Amps. In most cases, that's sufficient power to recharge two phones simultaneously. I plugged in my Android phone and my wife's iPhone 4 on a forty-five minute drive, and the charger recharged both phones even while they were in use - one for GPS and one for telephone calls. On the way home, I switched the iPhone with a Nexus 7 tablet, and while both devices were charging, it was at a noticeably slower rate than with two phones, which was expected for a charger with a maximum total output of 2.1 Amps.Only 2 inches long, the Etonic is one of the most compact car chargers that I've seen. It has a very solid feel, and it slid into the car's power port easily but securely. The two USB ports are marked \"1.0A\" and \"2.1A,\" although the labels are a bit hard to read.

It will charge both, but at a very slow rate.For a few bucks more, you can get theAnker 18W / 2.4A + 2.0A (3.6A max) Dual Port USB Car Charger for Apple Android and USB-Charing Devices - The First and Smallest Adapter to Provide Simultaneous, Full-Speed Charges to iPads and Smartphones [White].

This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit. These comparison tests I am quite pleased with this charger.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. I also charged my two devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test, 20 tests in total.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.I am attaching a collage of photos as video.

Note that I used high quality Samsung USB Cable that is the original cable that came with my devices. Also I plugged in the tablet in the top port.

This unit I selected to test because it is very finicky where charging is concerned and usually will only charge on a real Samsung charger!

In the past, I tried a cheap cable (no name brand) and the cable was thin and cheap looking. Then I plugged it into my Samsung charger and the device refused to charge at all. Simply would not begin the charge! When I unplugged that cable and inserted the Samsung cable or tried a higher end cable, the charge began.

Although this wall charger is designed for travel, you have to manually attach the prongs or leave them attached, which in either case doesn't make for a compact package. I'd much rather have the prongs fold into the body. And if I'm going to have four ports, I'd like to be able to charge four devices at full speed. Other wall chargers that I own have at least one 2.1 amp port for charging an iPad, and this remains constant, no matter how many other devices are attached. Not so with the Etronic Quad Port.I tested this with four devices -- iPad, iPhone, iPod, and Kindle -- all of which had 50% or less battery charge remaining. To mimic what I would do in a hotel room, I plugged them in using the Etronic Quad port before going to bed and unplugged them first thing in the morning. All four had full charges by morning. The sticking point, however, was the iPad, which displayed \"not charging\" after a few minutes of being plugged in. Still, it continued to charge. This also happens when I plug the IPad into certain USB hub ports because there isn't enough power running through them. It charges, but at a very slow rate. Using the Etronics with the iPad and other devices at the same time was the equivalent of using a low-powered USB port on my computer.This wall charger is okay if you won't include a tablet in your four devices or if you'll always use it overnight. In fact, it's quite convenient to be able to charge four devices from one power source.

Even though at the device end of the charging cable there are still many existing standards, the USB plug seems to justify the U in its name - it is becoming pretty near universal. However, the sheer number of such devices that I travel with - iPhone, iPad, Kindle, headphones, et.c - still means that I usually have to remember to take with me at least three or four chargers if I am to be able to charge all of my gadgets simultaneously. This is why I am always excited to come across a solution that can simplify my digital life and make it more tractable. This wall charger is definitely one such device.This charger enables you to simultaneously charge up to four different devices. All four of its its USB ports carry 2 A currents, which means you can simultaneously charge up to four different tablets. I've used this charger several times already, and was indeed able to charge four devices simultaneously. The charger is pretty solidly built, and it seems pretty reliable.I do have one issues with this charger though: The wall prongs are not foldable/retractable. This might not be as much of an issue with the small single/purpose chargers, but putting this kind of charger in your travel bag directly is less than ideal.There are also some external batteries that are about the size of this charger that can serve dual purpose: charging your devices when plugged in the wall AND while you are away from any wall outlets.

I only received the wall charger. It is a clean white wall charger with a blue company logo on the side and four USB ports pointing downwards (or upwards if you plug it in upside down). The four USB ports share the 2.1A total charging capacity. It also has an LED power indicator light around the ports.  The prongs detach with the press of a button and gives you two separate pieces for travel.  It looks nice and appears to have a nice build quality.&#9830; Use and Performance - I plugged it into a wall outlet and did some basic testing to see how the Etronic wall charger handles various charging situations.Test #1 (Single Charging) - I first tried charging my iPhone 5 by itself.  It had a charge of 20% at the start and after 30 minutes, the charge increased to 54%.  Better than 1% per minute, which is a very fast charging rate.  The charger performed well when charging a single phone.Test #2 (Simultaneous Charging) - Later that day, I took my iPhone 5 that had 32% charge and my iPad 2 that had 34% charge and charged them simultaneously.  After 10 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 43% and the iPad increased to 37%.  Again, very good results when charging two devices at the same time.  This is basically the best you are going to get because adding additional devices will continue to eat into the 2.1A total charging capacity.Conclusion:Overall, this is a nice 2.1A Quad Port USB Wall Charger. It is pretty small and compact for such a large number of ports.  It also has a nice quality build.  The total 2.1A output will not give you the fastest charging when charging four devices, but it does very well when charging one or two, and the additional ports can be used as needed.  Competing four port chargers have a much bigger form factor, so you are trading charging speed for compactness.  If you are looking for a quad port USB charger with good speeds in a small form factor, the Etronic is worth a look.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2013"}

All of the ports are recognized by my iPad as valid ports to charge, and they can supply 2.1A to charge the iPad at a full rate.  The problem is that the entire charger can only supply 2.1A, so if you plug in more devices, the 2.1A will be shared and the iPad will charge extremely slowly (as will your other devices).  It is senseless to have 4 ports and only 10W/2.1A of power.The other issue is that the company designed a travel charger, but in an attempt to make it country universal, the plug itself is a large plastic snap-on connection with a US power plug on it.  This saves them money on making different devices for Europe and Asia, but makes it far bigger for travel.I really like the Bolse 4 Port Premium High Output USB Wall/Travel/AC Rapid Charger (4 Amps / 20Watt / Fastest Speed) For iPhone, iPad, Samsung Android Smartphones - White as an alternative as it has a flip-out plug (far easier for packing than the Etronic plug) and has twice the power, so you really can charge 4 devices at once.If you are not going to travel, theEasyAcc 25 Watts 5V / 5A 4-Port USB Wall Charger (5V 2A x 2 & 5V 1A x 2) Multi Port USB Portable Charger battery charger for iPhone, iPad, iPod, Smartphones, 5V Tablets, Gopro, Bluetooth Speakers & Headphonesalso has 4 ports, but with 25W you certainly won't run out of power.I also was not a big fan of the ultra-bright blue light up USB ports.

Seems to me there is a lot of big talk, but very little to back it up.  The back of the zip lock package that these cables came in says this:  \"We love to hear from our customers and it really helps our business grow when you let us know how we did...  So, first of all, if any NukePak product ended up a dud for you, please let us know and we'll help you out.\"  Oh, really?  How?  As far as I can tell, the only way to talk to NukePac is through Amazon and the only recourse is to return the product at your own expense.  Been there, done that--and don't like that treatment at all!  To me, that is not a great warranty.  And if you wait more than 30 days, even Amazon's A to Z guarantee program won't help you.  How one would get NukePac to make good on a two-year guarantee is a mystery to me!I tried accessing the NukePac website and reached a \"forbidden\" site.

They all worked fine for syncing and charging the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4th Gens I tested them on. My initial review is below this and everything holds true for these new cords, except a couple improvements. I rated them four stars instead of five the first time because while they worked, they didn't \"wow\" me. I wasn't overly happy with the feel of the rubber insulation and I'd prefer the wire have less memory to it. I received three packs of three this time to review... one is a pack of all white cords, one is a pack with white, black and red cords (the red is what my wife would call \"tomato soup red\"), and one pack with blue, purple and pink cords (the blue is more of an aqua). The big improvement I see in this new set of cords is that they are perhaps 30% thicker than the previous samples and much thicker than any OEM cord I've ever seen. The connectors are very firmly attached to the wire. I pulled quite hard on the ends of a couple, actually hard enough to stretch and discolor the jacketing a little, and the ends held fast and worked like new when I tried them afterward. I have to admit that alone was quite impressive because I'm pretty sure my OEM iPod cord would have easily broken with the force I exerted on the cord. The new cords still have that slightly tacky feel to them and they still have more memory than I'd prefer, but they look very nice and their durability alone has caused me to upgrade my review from four stars to five. They are so nice in fact that in three days I've given one to my brother in-law, one to a friend of my wife, one to my wife's niece and one to my dentist's office girl. They look very nice and their extra length makes people want them badly. Unfortunately I can't post a new review, or a separate review for each product because Amazon only allows one review per reviewer per item and these are all listed on the product as the same item.I usually give away most of the sample products I get for review, but I'll definitely keep a couple of these for myself because they are definitely an improvement over the OEM Apple cords. When I first reviewed these, they were selling for $12.99, and now they're going for three dollars less and they are an improved product. Seems like a pretty good deal to me. I've been ripped off before when I bought junk cords that were DOA, but these kinda make up for that bad experience.***************************************************************** ORIGINAL REVIEW *****************************************************************I received a pack of these to review for NukePak, and so far they are working fine for both charging and syncing for both my friend's daughter's iPhone 4 and my family's two iPod Touch 4th Generation devices. The extra length (over OEM) is a nice feature, and the vibrant colors are a pleasant deviation from the old standard Apple cords.One thing I don't like is the feel of the cords. They are a little stiff, have some memory to them and almost feel a little tacky in my hands. I supposed the one benefit is that my cat, who eats anything that he finds resembling a string, won't touch these cords. He's eaten two sets of Apple OEM ear-buds already, so it's nice to know he doesn't like these.I see other reviewers have reported that these have stopped working within a few days or weeks. While I never feel obligated to post an undeserved favorable review for a product, I do feel I owe a timely review to sellers who provide me a sample . In the few days we've been using these, we've had no problems at all, but if the cords develop any issues, I will certainly update this review, like all my others, to reflect my experience over time. Taking into consideration the price at time of review ($12.99), this three pack of cords is a great bargain.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "UPDATED REVIEW, Rating Upgraded Due to Design Improvement", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}

This iFlash powerbank takes the slim road - very easy to carry, but it offers only 4400mAh of capacity.It is attractively designed with a white plastic case with a blue accent stripe along the edge. The on/off button is also blue, as is the charge level \"gas gauge.\" Nice color coordination. The build quality is solid - no rattles, well-anchored ports, and nice smooth seams on the case. The corners are all rounded to make it more comfortable to slip into a pocket. Although it comes with a carry pouch, it's really not needed since the powerbank is so compact (roughly 3.75 inches long and 1.75 inches wide).In addition to serving as a powerbank, there's an LED flashlight that is controlled with the on/off switch (double press to turn the flashlight on). It's a single LED, but puts out a decent amount of light.The capacity limits the practical use of this for phone or small device (e.g., ipod, mp3 player, etc.) charging. There's not enough reserve to make a meaningful recharge of a fully-depleted tablet.

Not a lot, but enough for most situations.  It is an attractive option for anyone who rarely needs to recharge but who wants the security of having extra power nearby. The construction is solid and smooth. I can't believe I'm saying this about a battery, but . . . I love the way it feels in my hand because of its rounded, glossy case.I am so dependent on my iPhone that I cringe when I see the battery depleting with no options in the near future to recharge, and that's why I never travel without an external battery.  This iFlash battery's capacity is too small for power-hungry devices such as the iPad. It's best to purchase this only if you want to use it exclusively for your smart phone. For tablets, you would be better off with an 8400mAh external battery, although the trade-off is a larger, heavier power source. This iFlash is sized perfectly to stash in a handbag or briefcase.This iFlash battery comes with nothing more than a blue mesh pouch for storage and a USB charging cable. You will have to supply your own device-specific USB cable to charge your device. You may want to get an extra but short smart phone cable to keep in the pouch; otherwise, you may find yourself in need of a charge without the ability to do it. Charging the battery takes a few hours and can be done at home. I do my charging overnight, although it takes much less time than that.  But charging my phone takes just a little more time than it would plugged into a wall.  My iPhone 5 went from 14% to full charge in about an hour and a half.Because of the price, this external battery would make a great stocking stuffer, particularly for teenagers and college students.

My iPad was 75% charged, but that last 25% can pull a lot of power from a battery pack.  If the 4400mAh iFlash can chug away powering up an iPad, no doubt it will keep your iPhone or iPod in business.This is a small, sleek unit and could easily be carried in a purse, knapsack, or briefcase.

I tested the charger with my Samsung Android cellphone (1800mAh battery) and my Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablet (4400mAh battery), plus my wife's iPhone 4 (1420mAh battery), and it worked fine with each of them. With most cellphones, a fully charged iFlash 4400 should be able to provide at least two full recharges. For 7\" tablets, about one full recharge is the limit. The iFlash 4400 will work with larger tablets (typically around 6000mAh battery), but it won't be able to provide a full charge.The iFlash 4400 is packaged with the charger, a USB cable with a micro-USB plug, and a carrying pouch. The micro-USB plug will fit a majority of mobile devices currently sold in the US, but for others, you'll need to provide your own cable and plug. You'll also need to provide an AC wall charger or vehicle charger to recharge the iFlash 4400. (The user guide shows the required input as DC5V/1A. I recharged it with two different AC adapters, one with 0.85A output, the other with 2.0A, and both worked okay.) The iFlash 4400 can also be recharged from a USB port on a computer, but at a slower rate.The iFlash 4400 is one of the smallest and lightest mobile chargers that I've seen. At 3.9\"x1.8\"x1\" and weighing only four ounces, it's small enough to carry in a pocket, and the smooth curved edges won't poke a hole in it. The built-in LED flashlight is a handy feature, as is the automatic shutdown after the unit is disconnected from a mobile device.Summary: If your cellphone only needs to be recharged once or twice a day, the iFlash 4400 is an excellent choice based on capacity, size and weight, and price. It can also be used for recharging small tablets.

Small size and simplicity is what makes this model different and it can be your favorite battery pack for as long as your phone charges through a Micro USB port (or you can supply your own wire) and you supply your own wall charger.It does come with some essential accessories: a charging cable that can be used to both charge your phone and charge it and a nice bluish nylon mesh bag to hold the iFLASH and the USB wire. Besides its ability to charge a phone once you plug it in - and do NOT attempt to use it with anything larger such as a tablet - the only other features include a blue-LEDs charge meter that activates once you press the one white button once and a one-LED flashlight capability that turns itself on or off if you double-tap the white button.I am very found of this model and can't think of any negatives other than the shiny black finish being a fingerprint magnet but I don't know anyone who would spend much time staring at a battery pack.

Overall, this battery pack performed very well based on the test described below.I received this power bank from the manufacturer for an honest review be it positive or negative. Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period.

Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate.

Its size is 2\" x 4\" x 7/8\".  It has nice rounded edges and feels nice in your hand.  My husband, who is normally oblivious to such things, said \"Oh, it is a cute one!\"  It comes in both black and white colors, and the manufacturer of this battery send me both.  This gave me a chance to test both and compare their performance. Ideally, one wants to see identical performance from both units as it would speak to a good quality control at the factory.

It's all plastic, but put together well, with smooth seams throughout. All the edges are rounded making it easy to slip into a pocket. However, while it is narrow (a bit under 2 inches wide) it is rather thick (about 3/4 inch thick). It's about 4 inches long.The USB output port is on the top next to a pretty bright LED flashlight. The input port for charging the powerbank is on the side. All ports are solidly built and well-anchored into the body of the powerbank.It has a \"gas gauge\" indicator to display the charge level left in the powerbank, and a nicely done round power switch to turn it on for charging and to use the flashlight.It comes with a decent cloth storage bag and a USB cable. It does not include an AC adapter or adapters for phones that don't use a standard micro USB port.I only have one complaint - the glossy case is a fingerprint magnet. Looks nice when it's clean, but it's nearly impossible to keep it looking glossy. It doesn't interfere at all with functionality, but if you're bugged by seeing fingerprint smudges, this is probably not a good choice.But other than the fingerprint issue, it's a nicely done powerbank with ample power for a typical phone.

I own several of them with varying amounts of power for exactly this reason.  This iFlash 4400mAh carries the least charge, but it is also the least expensive, making it an attractive option for anyone who rarely needs to recharge but who wants the security of having extra power nearby.  The construction is solid and smooth.  I can't believe I'm saying this about a battery, but . . . I love the way it feels in my hand because of its rounded, glossy case.I can get about 1.5 charges for my iPhone 5 out of this.  The amount of charge will increase slightly after you charge and drain it a few times, but the capacity/power transfer is too small for more power-hungry devices such as the iPad.  For those kinds of devices, you would be better off with an 8400mAh external battery, although the trade-off is a larger, heavier power source.  This iFlash is sized perfectly to stash in a handbag or briefcase.This iFlash battery comes with nothing more than a blue mesh pouch for storage and a USB charging cable. You will have to supply your own device-specific USB cable to charge your device since the package doesn't contain any adapters.  If you want to charge the battery via wall outlet, you'll also have to supply your own USB outlet adapter.  You may want to get an extra but short smart phone cable to keep in the pouch; otherwise, you may find yourself in need of a charge without the ability to do it.  Charging the battery takes a few hours and can be done at home.  I do my charging overnight, although it takes much less time than that.  But charging my phone takes just a little more time than it would plugged into a wall.  My iPhone 5 went from 14% to full charge in about an hour and a half.Because of the price, this external battery would make a great stocking stuffer, particularly for teenagers and college students.  This black version (there's a white-and-blue one, too) is a fingerprint magnet; however, the sleek look and feel is more important to me.

I've since tried out several of them and have come to appreciate how well they perform.  They are right up there with the best of them and I've discovered that they are quite impressive in the power department.  This particular battery pack is more user-friendly, especially if you only want to have a battery pack on hand to power up your iPhone or iPod.  This unit also comes inwhite with blue trimif you prefer.There are several ways to charge the iFlash including through your PC, an AC wall charger, or even a car charger.  I usually charge this type of battery pack by plugging it into my PC and leaving it overnight.  You will of course, have to provide your own USB cables, which usually isn't a problem. This is a minimalist unit for those who don't want all the extras that sometimes come with the battery packs.When I test any battery pack I usually use my iPad to see how well it performs.  It's rather informal, but is quite telling.  Can this battery pack cut the mustard?iFLASH Performance:Start: 75% (4 LEDs)15 minutes  79%  (4 LEDs)30 minutes  83%45 minutes  87%  (3 LEDs)60 minutes  90%75 minutes  94%  (2 LEDs)90 minutes  97%115 minutes  100%The the performance was really impressive for a 4400mAh battery pack.  Mind you, I didn't sit on it watching it every second as it charged, but was quite surprised at how hard to work to try to get my iPad back up to snuff.  My iPad was 75% charged, but that last 25% can pull a lot of power from a battery pack.  If the 4400mAh iFlash can chug away powering up an iPad, no doubt it will keep your iPhone or iPod in business.This is a small, sleek unit and could easily be carried in a purse, knapsack, or briefcase. The top of the battery pack has the four blue LED indicators. Beneath that on the front side is the small LED flashlight, and one output port.  I suspect that LED flashlight would be able to stay on for more than 200 hours continuously given the power of this battery (just a guess). It's small, but would be great in emergency situations.

I tested this on (3) devices.* Apple iPad 3rd Generation* HTC EVO 3D w/extended battery* Kyocera HydroThe power bank functioned perfectly with all of these devices, although it isn't intended for most tablets due most tablets having a much larger battery capacity than this power bank, but it will provide some extra time on the device. As for the (2) phones that I tested this on It charged them multiple times without any problems at all.Durability seems pretty good, I have tested other power banks, some of them seem fragile; however, this one seems sturdy considering its lighter weight than others.

The TUDIA logo is very faint, compared with the pictured unit.Note 3: When it's receiving power, the port labels (2.1A, 1.0A) are bright green.

When plugged into my car's power adapter, the front lights up with labels to indicate which port is 2.1 A and which is 1.0 A.  (The 2.1 is best for charging power hungry devices such as the iPad, although it can be used for phones as well.)  The cyan blue silcone stripes make it easy to find in a console full of stuff.  But, of course, the appearance doesn't matter if the device doesn't work -- and it does.  Beautifully.The Tudia charger fits snugly but doesn't require a lot of effort to plug in.  Likewise, the USB ports seem solid and well-constructed; I don't have to struggle to plug in my power cables.  My iPhone gets charged lightning-quick (with its lightning cable, of course!), just as if it were plugged into a home outlet.  I like that it powers off when a device if fully charged and that it does not get hot or make noise.With people carrying more and more devices on the road -- tablets, phones, cameras, Kindles -- it becomes important to be able to charge more than one at a time, particularly if there are two of you.  Before I had a dual port charger, my husband and I would have to take turns charging our phones, and we usually ended up arguing who needed the charge more.  Now one port belongs to him, and the other to me.  Thanks, Tudia, for the marriage counseling!

Let me say that this is an amazing little charger! I have used many USB Car chargers in the past, but so far this one is my favorite. The thing I like most about it is its compact size, there are many dual USB chargers in the market, but they all seem to be big and bulky, this one is the opposite its small and compact; however, just because its small doesn't mean its not as good as the others. This charger can charge at either 1 Amp or at 2.1 Amps! The USB ports clearly indicate which one is which, the difference? Well if the 1 Amp output is mostly for your phones, and the 2.1 Amps output is for your larger devices that need more power such as tablets. The four blue lines that you see on the sides of the charger provide grip in order to put and remove the charger from the car. Overall I really like this charger, it looks very durable and it seems that it will last a long time. An awesome product from TUDIA that I recommend you buy especially if you have a smartphone/tablet since they are constantly draining the battery life and having a pretty much universal charger in the car is necessary.

This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit. Based on these comparison tests I am quite pleased with this charger.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. I also charged my two devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test, 20 tests in total.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.I am attaching a collage of photos as video. They show the charger during the test with various devices. In the photos can also see a close up of the charger itself.The charger is compact it is 2\" long, 2\" tall, and 1\" wide.

I took my iPhone 5 that had 59% charge and my iPad 2 that had 62% charge and charged them simultaneously. After 15 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 75% and the iPad increased to 67%. I then switched the ports that the devices were plugged into and continued charging the devices.  After 10 more minutes, the iPhone increased to 85% and the iPad increased to 71%.  The iPhone charged at better than 1% per minute and the iPad charged at better than 3% per 10 minutes.  Some of the fastest individual charging results that I have ever seen, and this was achieved while charging simultaneously.  Really great results.  It did give off some heat when charging, but when plugged in and not in use, it gave off no heat at all.Conclusion:Overall, this could be the best dual port wall charger that I have ever seen.  It has a very large output capacity that charges multiple devices extremely fast.  On top of that it is very small and compact.  It is the perfect travel companion and I will most likely be using it exclusively at home to charge my devices because you don't have to guess which is the fast port, because they both are.

It cannot handle charging both tablets at the same time.I received this power bank from the manufacturer for an honest review be it positive or negative. Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; General features:======================Bolse AON 6 external battery weighs 5.1 oz.

Most of the more powerful battery packs are shaped like a pack of cards, but this one has a nice ergonomic design that makes it comfortable to hold.  There are no sharp edges and the rounded lengthwise body of this battery pack makes it quite unique.  The extra accessories are always a plus in my book because you never know when you'll need them, for yourself or someone else.This small battery pack really isn't made to power up a tablet, but I always try out a battery pack on one to see just what kind of power they have.

This battery pack really was a work horse and gave an unexpectedly impressive performance.  If it can actually charge up an iPad this well, it certainly has enough power to charge up a couple of smaller devices readily.The only problem I had, and it is a visual one on my part, was that I had trouble seeing where those LED lights were at.

This model is on the lower end of power, but also the lower end of price.  You don't always need a heavy, high-capacity battery for just smart phones.First the battery pack is about one pound and measures 1\" X 3\" X 4-1/2\". The side of the unit with the power button displays five bright-blue LED lights.  These show you 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of charged remaining power.There are also two ways to charge your External Battery. You can choose from a Micro USB power port that has a male USB on the end or the other male USB cable that has a universal female port on the other end for one of the (4) four attachments (one will fit your device).  There is also a nice black pouch that will keep the battery and all the attachments safe and together. It's a real necessity.Just some geek info: \"mAh\" means `Milli-ampere hour'. It's the rating of the battery. It means your battery is of 5,200 mAh rating.Charging through the Micro to USB port (on my PC) took about (6-7) hours to charge and using the DC charger took about (5-6) hours to charge. So overnight charging will keep you powered for a long time. This can all vary a bit from outlet to outlet and PC to PC.I have an iPhone 4S and it will charge about 2-1/2 times from around 15%-20% of a starting charge.  It charged my iPad mini once from 20%.  Both together charged once and took about (9.0) nine hours.  (Never let your device go below 10% in order to keep the battery capacity at its best).I would suggest charging one device at a time to be sure of a full charge in a faster time. The white color with the almost mirrored surface is attractive, but shows smudges, if that really bothers you. All (4) attachments and the (2) cables are also white.I would suggest looking at all Bolse battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler.

Also included are a micro USB charging cord and a power cord with four adapters: 30-pin iPhone, mini USB, micro USB, and a round pin one I guess might be Nokia.There is a quirk related to the indicator lights on the power bank.  It's different from other power banks in that there are five indicator lights all lined up.  They look identical and they are unmarked but one of them on the end is actually a charging indicator light.  So, when charging the power bank, only four lights will light up to indicate a full charge.  When charging a device, the one light on the end will light up.  This is very different from most other power banks where all lights are power indicator lights and they light up to indicate the device is charging.This is a nice power bank.  With it, I can charge my iPhone 4S twice with some juice left to give it one more partial charge.  It will charge two devices at the same time.

I have to admit I'm a real fan of the Bolse power packs, as I have a couple of other higher powered ones, and they are top-notch when it comes to performance and charging capacity. While the AON6 is on the low end when it comes to capacity, it's still a great choice to have tucked away in a pocket or purse should you happen to run low on a charge before you can get to your regular phone charger.The AON6 has two USB outputs, so you technically could recharge two devices at once if you needed to. The unit comes with one micro-USB cable for charging, and one USB cable with four interchangeable plugs for various devices (figure that means most phones minus the Apple lightning connector). Everything stores in a small velvet pouch so you don't lose all the small bits that seem to go missing of their own accord.For charging my iPhone 4, I ran it down to about 45% and then started a charge from the AON6. In 20 minutes, I had climbed to 65%, which isn't too bad in my book. That'd be perfect for that \"just five more minutes\" situations you might find yourself in by the end of the day. My iPad 4 was much slower to charge, but that's to be expected given the additional power drain it takes. Overall, it looks like I could get nearly two full charges on my iPhone if necessary. That would make the AON6 a good choice for a lighter weight external battery to carry around on a regular basis \"just in case.\"I've come to believe that you can never have too many external batteries on hand and charged up should you have an extended power outage.

This small and effective portable Bluetooth speaker enables me to partake in both of those activities, and so I've discovered the pleasures of listening to the music in my bathroom.The speaker is very well built overall, with the rubberized outer shell covering most of its front and the sides.

I am not sure how easy it is to pair it up with other smartphones, tablets, and computers but my guess would be that it should not be much of the problem either.The sound quality was pretty good, especially for a device of this size. If you end up mostly using it in the shower room then there will be some entirely expected audio distortions due to the small size of the surrounding space. There are also limitations to the sound quality of any device that uses Bluetooth standard for the signal transmission, but unless you are a very strict audiophile this will not be much of an issue for you.One issue that I have with this speaker is that it's easy to skip tracks or change listening playlists. Once you decide what you are listening to in the shower, you are pretty much committed.

Inside the box was the speaker, a proprietary USB charging cable and an instruction manual.  The speaker looks cool and had a nice blue color.  It has rubberized buttons and a rubber cover that closes off the charging port.  On the front, it has a circular grouping of buttons that has a play/pause button, two combined FF/RW and volume buttons, a power button and a speakerphone button with microphone.  On the back there are holes for the speaker and a large suction cup.  It looks like it is built well.&#9830; Use and Performance - I plugged in the included USB charging cable into the unit and into my computer to give it an initial charge before testing it out.  Once the speaker was charged, I easily paired it to my iPhone 5 a did a variety of tests to try it out.Test #1 (Sound Quality Test) - At my desk, I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to some Pop Music to Excision Bass Heavy Dubstep (the Destroid album), and the speaker performed very well.  It reached pretty high volumes while still maintaining clarity.  It sounded really good overall for a single speaker setup that is focused on being a shower speaker, not a HiFi speaker.Test #2 (Shower Test) - I then tried it out in the shower.  I started playing a playlist on my phone and left it on the counter about six feet away from the shower.  You have to get the music going on your device first because you can only really do pause/play and skip songs backwards and forwards.  Best bet is to use a playlist or shuffle several songs. In the shower, the sound was really good.  It got very loud at times, so much so, that I had to turn it down by holding down the RW button (which controls volume also).  The controls were great for moving between songs and adjusting the volume.  During my shower, I moved the speaker from the glass walls to various place on wall tile that had minimal texture to it and the suction cup stuck very firmly in all cases.  I then had my wife take my phone out of the bathroom and walk it across the house.  It stayed connected until it got very far away all the way to my office.  I would say it had at least a 20 foot range through several walls.  Plenty of range if you want to leave your phone outside of the bathroom and away from all that humidity.Conclusion:Overall, this was a great little shower speaker.  It sounded great and had great range.  It had nice controls and was fun.  I told my Wife that this would be great for the kids to listen to songs while they were taking their bath at night, and I think she got a little jealous.  I think she wants one for our shower.  Looks like I might have to pick up a second one.  If you are looking for a fun shower speaker that sounds good and works well, this one is a great choice.

To test the speaker's watertightness, I attached it to the tile wall below the shower head support while I took a shower last night. It didn't get any direct spray, but it got plenty of splatter and was soaked after a minute or two. It worked fine, though, and afterwards, I shook it and wiped it dry.The speaker paired easily with my Kindle Fire HD. The audio quality playing MP3 music was acceptable for such a small device. The specs don't list the audio output power, but based on my experience with other small portable speakers, my guess is about 3-4 watts. The music can be controlled from either the phone/tablet or the controls on the speaker. [Note that the speaker does not have a 3.5mm audio port, so it can't be hard-wired to an audio source.]I only tested the speaker for playing music from my Kindle Fire. As for using the speaker for phone calls in the shower, I just don't think that I want to be that available.The user guide indicates that the speaker's internal battery can be recharged through a USB port on a computer or from a 5V AC wall adapter. A 39-inch charging cable is included - don't lose it, because the plug is a nonstandard type that might be hard to replace. The charging port is covered by a water-resistant flap that opens to allow access.I have one slightly negative comment, but it's not a deal-breaker, just a small annoyance: The control markings on top of the speaker are a little hard to read unless the light is just right.If you're looking for a small portable Bluetooth speaker, the Abco Tech speaker is definitely worth a look, especially if you need a speaker that will operate in damp environments like the bathroom or kitchen, or outdoors near a lake or pool, or in rainy weather.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A versatile speaker that performs in wet and dry conditions", "unixReviewTime": 1385251200, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2013"}

It adhered beautifully to my stainless steel refrigerator. There the volume is more than adequate, and the sound itself is excellent to my ears.What is especially nice about this speaker is you can answer and end phone calls with it as well as redial the last number. The controls are simple and pairing it with my phone was a snap - I held down on the on/off switch for about six seconds and it beeped and started alternating blue and orange blinking lights. I scanned for bluetooth devices with my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it popped up, paired and connected.Here are a few things that I do not like. First, the charging cable is not the common USB-to-micro USB type. It has USB on one end and a small straight jack on the other. I understand why this is used because it allows a watertight plug to fill the charging jack. However, it's an uncommon cable that may be difficult to replace if you lose or damage the one that comes with this speaker.The other thing I do not like is the process for turning the speaker off. Merely pressing the on/off switch will not work. You have to use your device's bluetooth settings to break the connection between the device and the speaker, then use the on/off switch. While this is not a show stopper it is inconvenient.Overall I am pleased with the speaker because of the sound quality and the phone features. I can live with the issues I cited above, and while my shower head drowns this out other models may not.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Waterproof and will work in a shower, but ...", "unixReviewTime": 1385164800, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2013"}

Just charge it up and suction it to the shower wall. I'm no fan of suction power, but I've had this one up for more than two weeks and the suction cup shows no sign of letting up.Pairing is easy. I paired it with both my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet and my iPhone without problems. Reconnecting is automatic on the iPhone. I just have to choose the device on the Fire.The Bluetooth range is excellent. I took my iPhone out of the bathroom, out the bedroom, down the stairs and the speaker still played.Battery life is great. I charged it once and two weeks later, it's still going. Mind you, I only turn it on while using the shower.All the controls work well. I can skip music, go back, pause, play, adjust volume . . . and answer the phone. I'm not sure who wants to answer the phone while in the shower. I imagine all the noise from the water would make it difficult for the person on the other end. Nevertheless, I tested it -- with the water off, as that's what I would do if I actually answered the phone in the shower. The sound from the speaker is excellent. I can hear the caller like I could directly on my cell phone. It's clear as can be. The other end is much more like from a speakerphone. It's a muddier sound, though it doesn't cut in and out. I suspect the echoing in the shower is the cause of that, but that's where it would be used, so that's where I tested it. Call back last number works. No Siri.The only problem I've discovered is the play button doesn't work on my Kindle Fire when I'm playing the Songza app (it will pause the music, but it won't restart the music). This is just app specific, because the play button does work with the mp3 music I have on the Kindle itself. I also have the Songza app on my iPhone and the play button works just fine there.Music sounds great coming out of this little thing.

I get off key, forget the words to the songs and sometimes I sing too loud. It annoys the rest of the household, even the dogs. So when Abco Tech sent me a sample of their Bluetooth waterproof shower speaker, I was kind of excited to try it. Music from this speaker might help keep me on key and would at least help with remembering the words. But, according to my husband, the real beauty of it is that it can be turned up loud enough to drown me out!The speaker comes with an adapter that plugs into a wall outlet and the other end into the speaker. It flashes a red light until it's charged, which goes off when it's full. Then I just pressed the power button and held it down for 6 seconds until a red light alternating with a blue started flashing. That meant it was in pairing mode I turned on my I Touch and went to the settings and turned on the Bluetooth. The shower speaker showed up on my iTouch list of devices right away. I selected it and then went to a favorite playlist to play some tunes.There's a big suction cup on the back of the speaker, almost as large as the speaker itself. I cleaned an area near the top of the shower door with glass cleaner and then just a little rubbing alcohol to make sure it was really clean. The place where I placed it was out of the direct line of the shower spray. It stuck up there easily and seems to be pretty stable. Playing with the volume and phone buttons didn't seem to bother it's sticking ability.It's great to have this little speaker in the shower. Both the bass and the high notes sound very good for a speaker this size. (Even with soap in your ears!) I can put the iTouch up to about 30 feet away, even behind walls, and it stays connected. If I'm using my iPhone to play music and the phone rings amid all the singing and carrying on, I just hit the little phone button to take the call and this becomes a hands-free speakerphone. I told some today that I was taking an iShower! It could come in handy if you're waiting for a call and don't want to miss it in the shower. It's a fun product and would make a good gift because it's useful and probably not something most people would have.

I love the concept, but no matter how easy everyone says they are to apply, I always end up with bubbles.So when Zeetron offered to send me a complimentary sample to use, I actually laughed at them. I informed them I only did EASY and that I would mark it down (severely) if it had bubbles. I don't do bubbles. I hate screen protectors. They promised me I would find it easy. So I agreed to accept a sample for my iPhone 4.This week, I upgraded my iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5s. The following day the screen arrived. OOOPS. Now I had to convince my daughter that I could do it on her iPhone 4s! I promised her that there would be no bubbles. She laughed. I promised her I would take it off if she didn't like it. She finally gave in after I showed her the video Zeetron posted on You Tube. But she watched me.And I was shocked. I put the button on the way they said, and made sure it worked correctly. Yep, it clicked. Siri said Hi when I held it down too long.Next, after cleaning it with alcohol and the cloth, I peeled off side one and placed it loosely onto the surface, making sure the hole was centered over the home button. Then I did what it said in the video, I lightly tapped it. Just one little tap. And this screen attached itself! One bubble in the corner easily was pushed out with the provided Squeegee (covered with the cloth). Voila, a perfect cover!Let's be honest, my daughter is NOT going to let me test the hardness on her iPhone. No keys, no scissors, no rocks. She won't even let me test the waterproof nature of the screen. Such a spoilsport!The things I was able to test (after she unlocked her phone) include the fact that I noticed it did not collect fingerprints as easily. The swiping motion worked seamlessly. When I tried it on Smule, I had no problem hitting the notes. It seems to be totally clear with no glare problems. On the other hand, she tends to type a lot on her cell phone and said it isn't \"quite\" as sensitive to that type of touch as before.There was one small issue that bothered her. She had a very snug fitting case and it took a bit of effort to get it back on, at first she was afraid it wouldn't fit. Since this is .4mm thick, you should be aware that it could be a problem.I really and truly love this and would buy one for my new phone except that you need to cover the home button, and since you need that uncovered to read fingerprints, it may be awhile before they come out with a shield for me.So, from I hate screen protectors to five stars, quite a journey.

This product, the Bionic Shield Premium iPhone Tempered Glass Screen Protector with Oleophobic Coating for iPhone 4/4S, was supplied by the manufacturer to me for the purpose of an honest, unpaid review.I own an iPhone 4S, which generally is encased in aOtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case & Holster for iPhone 4 & 4S  - Retail Packaging - Blackwhich has a built-in screen protector.  Prior to getting that case I usedTech Armor Apple iPhone 4/4S Premium HD Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [3-Pack] - Retail Packagingto protect my device's screen. Both are acceptable options to me, and both show fingerprints and neither offers substantial protection against some types of scratches.Zeetron Bionic Shield - PRODUCT INSTALLATION:Installing this screen protector is very easy, but you need to take your time.  Go slowly when placing the protector on your iPhone's screen, as lining up the edges is critical to proper placement and installation success.Wipe off any smudges prior to installation; using the included alcohol wipe.  Let the screen face thoroughly dry prior to installing the protector.Peel off the #1 label first, and place the protector on your screen.  If any bubbles appear, use the included squeegee, but be gentle and again, take your time.  If you don't, you run the risk of cracking the protector and/or your iPhone's screen.After you are satisfied that the bubbles are rubbed out, peel off the #2 tab to finish installation.  A bit of rubbing with the included microfiber cloth and/or squeegee may still be necessary.Product should now be installed on your iPhone.OPTIONAL BUTTON INSTALLATION:Included with the protector is a bonus.  Two decorated aluminum buttons - one black and one silver - come with the Zeetron Bionic Shield.  If you choose to install a button on your iPhone, do it before you install the shield.  It will be slightly raised, as it sits on top of the existing Home button on the iPhone.PRO's to Bionic Shield:+ Installation is easy by comparison to the peel and stick variety of screen protector that is flimsy and flops around. See YouTube for a video: \"How to install the Zeetron Bionic Shield\" prior to installation.+ The 9h hardness offers a nice bit of protection against everyday scrapes and scuffs which come directly at the face of the iPhone.+ Scratch-proof, shatter-proof, and water-resistant per Zeetron. (I didn't scratch at it with a sharp instrument or dribble water on it to test this out!)+ Screen protector is perfectly sized for iPhone 4/4S screen.+ Fingerprints and smudges are almost non-existent when this shield is applied to your iPhone.+ Price is on-point with the quality of the product.+ Touch sensitivity isn't affected, allowing for smooth operation of your iPhone with screen installed.CON's to the Bionic Shield:- It's made of glass, and the tempered glass can crack or break, which could potentially damage your iPhone's screen.- The edges of the screen protector slightly increase the thickness of your iPhone, which undoubtedly will be an issue with some iPhone cases. (0.4mm thick)- The edges of the protector are vulnerable to chips because the shield is tempered glass.- It's unclear whether or not the Bionic Shield can or will be displaced or cracked by a bump to the side of it, which catches the edge of the inflexible edge of the shield.- It's unclear whether the silicon adhesive that works so well to keep the Zeetron Bionic Shield in place will somehow damage the iPhone should you wish to someday remove the Bionic Shield.- Zeetron states the shield's rounded edges help to deflect shock from bumps and drops to the LCD screen on the iPhone. \"Huh?\" If you drop your phone and it's not in a protective case, it's likely it will get damaged.- No warranty.  Maybe it exists, but I couldn't find any warranty information on the Zeetron site or the Bionic Shield packaging regarding a stated or implied product warranty.CONCLUSION:The Zeetron Bionic Shield Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector will appeal to iPhone users who don't mind paying a bit more for functional, amped-up of screen protection that also resists fingerprints.It's quality protection, well packaged and easy to install, but there are a few things that prevent me from wholeheartedly recommending this product to iPhone users.Issues may arise with screen protector removal, protector cracking or edge chipping, and iPhone case fit with the Bionic Shield installed.No warranty information was available for this product on Amazon, the Bionic Shield packaging (or insert) nor on the Zeetron site.  This may affect the buyer's ability to receive a product replacement if a cracked or chipped screen is received, or if your iPhone screen is damaged by use of the Bionic Shield - compensation for your expensive device!NOTE: ZEETRON SELLS DIY REPLACEMENT PART KITS for iPhones, iPads and iPods.  A DIY screen replacement kit from Zeetron for an iPhone 4/4S is about fifty bucks, with an iPhone 5 DIY kit being around one-twenty five to one-fifty (on Zeetron site).I would love to see Zeetron offer a warranty where at the very least you would be given a Zeetron DIY screen replacement kit (like shown in the links below) for your phone IF your iPhone screen was damaged by use of the Bionic Shield.Iphone 4S Front Glass Digitizer LCD Assembly Replacement Kit White (Includes Tools, Cloth and Microfiber)Zeetron iPhone 5 Black Premium Screen Repair Kit (Full Tool Kit + Screen Protector + Zeetron Cloth)UPDATE #1: (Same day as review was written I notified Yurly at Zeetron of posting.

If you drop the phone with the shield installed or bash it until your arm falls off it will not, I repeat will not effect your screen. This is the whole point of the protector. Yes the shield may break but your screen will never break. I can even proudly state that if you take a hammer and bash your screen and it your screen cracks I will replace it for your for free.  We tested this many times prior to production. Anyway just wanted to clarify that with you.\"FYI... take this info for what it's worth.As for me, I won't be be bashing my screen until my arms fall off to test out this claim, as if I did, replacing my screen or screen protector would be the least of my worries!UPDATE #2: (Same day, second email from Yurly at Zeetron after being informed I added his email to my review.)From Yurly at Zeetron - \"Thank you. The reason I replied the way I did was because you provided incorrect information. - It's made of glass, and the tempered glass can crack or break, which could potentially damage your iPhone's screen. The screen will not crack. It will crack the shield before cracking the glass itself. I hope you did not take my response the incorrect way. I was only trying to clarify on your review.\"I stand by my review, and opinion as written.I believe this to be a good product, with issues to be considered by the consumer. I'm not running a scientific laboratory like Consumer Reports (or like at Zeetron) where I can line up iPhones and smash screens to make sure the 'protector' is working. I own one iPhone and since I paid a lot for it, I want to keep it in working order for a long time.I believe that since there is no warranty given by Zeetron for the iPhone's screen (not the Bionic Shield), no representative from Zeetron should claim that the iPhone's screen (not the Bionic Shield) will not crack. **Of course the shield will crack first - it's on top of the screen and impact would come from the front - hitting the Bionic Shield first!**Sometimes reviewer opinions will not please the manufacturer (as it appears in this case...), and if you're a potential buyer of a product and reading reviews, you're certainly smart enough to read them and make your own decision as to whether or not the product is right for you.I posted the emails received to add to the validity that this is an unbiased, unpaid, objective review, written in hopes of helping others to make educated Amazon purchases.IF YOU WISH TO CONTACT ZEETRON:For more information on the Bionic Shield, or to speak with Yurly or another Zeetron rep, go to their website (contact info including email and phone numbers are available) at the bottom of the page.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very good protection, but a few issues give me pause", "unixReviewTime": 1380153600, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2013"}

Screen protectors never last on my devices for varying reasons - I want to give a couple of those reasons . Bionic Shield sent me a sample of this item - this review is my honest opinion.1) YOU CAN TELL THERE'S A SCREEN PROTECTORThere's nothing worse than knowing your phone has a screen protector. Often I have found that screen protectors result in a decrease in tactile or visual quality. Inferior quality plastic or glass will refract light, creating rainbow patterns on your screen (hardly fun wen you're trying to read an email outdoors), and sometimes will even dull colors.2) THEY DON'T GO ON CLEANLYI would venture to say that the majority of issues with applying screen protectors come down to user error. I have still encountered several that just would not apply properly, regardless of how carefully I put them on. I encountered a couple a few years ago that were not perfectly flat and would bubble out despite my having squeegeed the heck out of them.WHAT ABOUT THE BIONIC SHIELDHere's why the Bionic shield went on my phone and hasn't been off since.1) It's super high quality.2) It's HIGHLY protective (I was sent two and had some fun with one of them...)3) You literally cannot tell it is on4) It goes on easily and stays on.5) I could keep my current case with it*6) It came with home button stickers so that there wasn't a dip from the added depth*CONS?The only con I can foresee is that the added depth may be too much for some cases. Being a little bit flexible, my Incipio case went over the Bionic shield, but just barely. Some more rigid iPhone cases may have issues, so I thought it worth mentioning.OVERALLAs I mentioned, I was sent two of these screen protectors and used one for testing. A couple of nails, a knife and a dropped stapler later, and I feel very confident that my iPhone has the best protection a screen protector can offer. I highly recommend this protector - it's going to do a whole lot more than a plastic protector, and it is by far the best quality I have yet seen. With the one caveat that some rigid cases may not account for the extra depth, I have no hesitations in recommending this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An exceptional product.", "unixReviewTime": 1382313600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2013"}

All I had to do was apply a home button decal (this is a must, or else the shield won't properly attach), remove the first layer of film, line up the shield with the edges, and tap the shield.  The screen protector attaches itself in a matter of seconds, and it's actually fun to watch it progress across the surface.  If a bubble or two remain, you can use the included squeegee to get rid of them.  When the shield is completely attached, you remove the second film, and voil&agrave;!  You have a crystal clear screen protector that looks as good as the iPhone 5 glass screen.  Even better, I find that the Bionic Shield is easier to wipe clean than the Belkin protector I was using, and it also doesn't seem to pick up dirt/grease at the same rate, thanks (I suppose) to the oleophobic coating.  I had forgotten how beautiful the iPhone screen could be.  And because the Bionic Shield sits a little within the lip of the iPhone, I can use it with any case I own.If you mess up the shield application -- it's difficult to get it wrong, but more on that later -- you can pull it off and reposition it as long as you don't remove the second film and take care not to touch the phone screen and the bottom of the Bionic Shield.  Because it's a thin layer of glass, it won't bend, buckle, or stick to itself the way other protectors can.  How do I know this?  Well, I'm one of the rare people who managed to screw up the initial application by not applying the home button.  I thought that because the two included buttons (one black and one silver) were called \"decorative\" that they were also optional.  When I tapped the screen, everything attached but the bottom, so I knew right away the mistake I had made.  With the help of my daughter since I needed extra hands, I removed the shield, applied the new home button, re-aligned the shield, and tapped.  This time, the screen attached itself completely.  I had one tiny bubble that disappeared with a single push of the squeegee.The Bionic Shield and my iPhone have been knocking about in my handbag -- against coins and keys -- without a single scratch.  There's a YouTube video that shows multiple attempts to scratch it, to no avail, and while I'm not about to try the same tests on my phone, I believe them.  Basically, the Bionic Shield is a second glass screen that protects the first.  Since iPhone 5s (and other models) are known for cracked faces on impact, the Bionic Shield is a great way to protect my investment.  I cannot praise the product highly enough.

So often the screen becomes scratched form pocket carrying (unless you have a case) but now that problem is a thing of the past. There are several screen protectors for iPhones (and for all cell phones) but in general they are near disposable and don't stand up to constant use. Now that is no longer a problem.Zeetron has made a special Bionic Shield for the iPhone 5 (they also have one for iPhone 4) and this shield is chemically treated and processed to the standard of being a transparent tempered glass. The surface is very hard and resists scratches form almost anything that could rub against it. It also has a special `oleophobic' (lacking an affinity for oils) coating that not only prevents fingerprints, but also is easily cleaned. The shield is backed with a silicon adhesive which is completely transparent and while the instructions for applying the shield to your iPhone are included in the packaging (along with other pieces of equipment like two metallic home buttons to elevate the on button once covered for heightened sensitivity to touch, a microfiber cloth, alcohol pad and squeegee), but it also points the purchaser to a site on the You Tube where step by step instructions for installations are given in video format [...].This is a reliable easy to install long lasing up to the moment scientifically designed shield for that iPhone that does not reduce finger sensitivity and is waterproof!

The flexible screen protectors that we've put on it help, but none have lasted more than a few months, so I was looking forward to seeing if the Bionic Shield was as good as its promotional video looked [search for \"Bionic Shield\" on YouTube - it's the 2:19 video].The screen protector was pretty easy to apply. The key is to make sure the screen is completely free of dust and fingerprints before applying the tempered glass protector. The screen protector kit includes a little microfiber cloth and alcohol pad to help with this. Then it's a simple matter of applying the iPhone's Home button and protector, and using the included squeegee card to remove any bubbles of air. A silicone adhesive keeps the screen protector attached. Note: The install guide that's packaged with the kit is very general. Before installing the screen protector, be sure to watch the YouTube video for very clear instructions (it's brief, only about 2 minutes). [[...]The sensitivity of the iPhone's screen to touches and swipes did not appear to be significantly affected by the screen protector. And since the kit included a new Home button, the button worked normally. As far as testing the Bionic Shield's resistance to scratches, I didn't have the nerve to do what they did in the demo video, but I tried scratching the protector with a few household items, and it resisted my moderately vigorous efforts to damage the screen.

First of all, it was extremely easy to apply. I did it while waiting to be seated at a restaurant.1) I completely wiped down the face with the supplied wet wipe. The wet wipe took care of any oils but there were some wipe marks left.2) I used the supplied microfiber cloth to clean off the wipe marks until the face was completely free of any marks or oils.3) Removed the clear plastic film marked (1) from the shield, centered it on the phone and placed it on.4) Tapped the shield lightly in the middle and it applied itself squeezing out all the air.5) Removed the blue plastic film marked (2) and used the supplied squeegee to press it down.6) That's it. Because the shield is rigid, it is much easier to apply than protective film. You don't really have to worry about air bubbles or creases in film. But I have to say you should have a steady hand because I would not want to reapply it if it goes on crooked the first time.Function:1) Because it's a rigid shield with a thickness of 0.4mm, it does add thickness to your phone. However it also made the phone more rigid. The whole phone feels more solid. I was also able to fit on the phone's protective case without any problems.2) Protection. Passed the test with flying colors. We tried to scratch it all through dinner with the utensils on the table and none could scratch it. Felt good about that. The shield should also help the phone face from breaking because it's an extra layer on top of it.3) Doesn't reduce touch sensitivity.Overall, there are more pros than cons. The pros are that it's easy to apply and the shield is tempered glass with all its inherent toughness. The con is that it adds a little thickness to your phone. I think that the durability and the toughness of the glass trumps plastic film.If you want a durable and tough shield for your phone then I would highly recommend considering this. I received a sample from the manufacturer to try and I'm glad I did because I would not have considered a glass face until I tried this one.Addendum iPhone5:I also received a sample for the iPhone5 from Zeetron to test and because the page won't allow me to post a review for the iPhone5 I'm adding it to the bottom here.1) Application is the same as above. Very easy to apply.2) Protection:a) I decided to put it to the test and tried all manner of sharp objects to scratch it. I ran screwdrivers, scissors, nail clippers, box cutters, nails and keys across the front and failed to scratch it. I'm very impressed with this. The sharp points basically just slid off the glass. This should definitely stand any normal abuse.b) I also tried to smudge it. The shield is supposed to have some kind of oleophobic coating, and again it works. The shield failed to smudge.Overall, very pleased with it's protective qualities. If you tend to be very hard on your phone, I would definitely recommend this. Put it on a brand new phone and it will stay new. Highly recommended.Final update:With repeated scraping from a knife, shiv, machete, axe and a Swiss Army knife we were finally able to put some small scratches on the face plate. Still the tiny scratches were hard to notice after rubbing with the microfiber cloth and it's fairly unlikely this would constitute normal usage so I would still consider the shield very good protection with normal usage.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent!

It comes in a fold out plastic package with an Alcohol rub cloth, a squeegee (bubble remover), two decorative aluminum buttons and EXPLOSION proof tempered glass film.

This is very critical. Then carefully center your tempered glass unit on top, using the circular hole for orientation. Remove the first peel before applying it. Set it gently and press an area near the button and the tempered film magically attaches itself to your camera covers surface from bottom up. There is no rubbing or worry. It literally attaches itself.Finally, use the squeegee to remove any bubbles (there won't be if you are lucky) and then use it to rub down the corners for a secure and tight shield seal. I will not test this, but it is supposed to protect the corners and surface of your phones glass from hard knocks, drops and particularly sharp objects.

Erb", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "UPDATE: 3/1/2014 - I reinstalled a replacement Bionc Shield sent to me by the company. I use a case on my iphone. Within one day of installing the replacement, the screen protector began to get pushed up around the edges by the case on my iPhone. And I've already noticed a thin scratch on the surface.UPDATE: 10/1/2013 - Today I noticed that the bottom edge of the screen protector had \"crunched\" or broken. There was an area that was crunched and a thin hairline crack radiated away from the crunched area off to the right edge of the screen. So not only did this screen protector become scratched in multiple areas in less than a week, it also cracked.The seller sent me another screen protector which I will now place on my phone. I have already removed the cracked screen protector. It broke in several places and very easily, as I was gently trying to pry it off my phone. There is no \"glue\" to speak of, just a thin layer of silicone that is what adheres to the iPhone screen like a suction cup.----I've had many different types of screen protectors on my iPhone over the last 3 years. With the exception of the Bionic Shield, they have all been some type of plastic of one kind or another. None have lasted more than 6-8 months max. They usually end up peeling off the phone or developing bubbles underneath.The primary issue has always been that they begin to peel off and seldom last longer than 6-8 months. However all of them have been really good at protecting the screen from scratches.The Bionic Shield by Zeetron is different. It is not plastic but is actually made of a very thin glass. Additonally, it has what is called an oleophobic coating that helps to prevent fingerprints from collecting on the glass. It works splendidly at resisting fingerprints. You also get some aluminum iPhone home button covers. These are not a gimmick, they actually work well. Since the Bionic Shield adds a very minor amount of thickness to your screen, your home button would be ever so slightly below the surface. That's where these button covers come into play. Not only do they look cool, but they raise the button back up so that it is nearly flush with the top surface.I am enjoying less fingerprints on my glass. However in just a few number of days after installing the Bionic Shield installed, I noticed several small scratches on the Bionic Shield glassThis is a more expensive screen protector than many el-cheapos that are out there. The Bionic Shield is better than most at resisting fingerprints, but sadly I can not say the same thing for its ability to resist scratches. Less than 24 hours after installing the Bionic Shield, I noticed a 1/4\" scratch on the screen protector.It is possible that the Bionic Shield might have prevented my iPhone screen from getting scratched, and I do mean might, but more than likely the iPhone screen would not have been scratched by whatever scratched the Bionic Shield. My iPhone screen had been unprotected for 6 months prior to installing the Bionc Shield and had no scratches on it. Less than 24 hours after installing the Bionic Shield, it had a scratch. Over the next two days I notced additional small scratches on the Bionic Shield. And after a few more days it actually got \"crunched\" (broken) along the bottom edge.Here is the bottom line so far...- This is marketed as having \"anti-chip corners.\" Mine chipped.- This is marketed as having \"surface hardness 8-9H: ...even sharp objects such as kinves and keys will not scratch the Bionic Shield.\" Mine was scratched within 24 hours and days later had additional numerous scratches over the surface.The reality is that this does not live up to its hype and is actually less durable than other non-glass screen protectors I've used in the past.I do have to say that the distributor has sent me another screen protector to try. I do not see why the replacement would perform any differently than the original that became scratched and broken in just a week.I was provided a sample of the Bionic Shield for testing and review.

It looks like glass, it feels like glass, it is glass. I've shown it to friends and family and everyone is equally impressed. I am getting compliments all over the place.It's the easiest screen protector to install. The hardest part is making sure there's no lint on the screen before starting. After the applying, I thought I had a scratch on the Bionic Shield, but that scratch turned out to be a bubble in the shape of a scratch. It and the other tiny bubbles disappeared after a few days, just like directions said would happen.At the end of three weeks, the protector was smooth and clear, with the exception a tiny little chip along the edge of the Bionic Shield. I took off the screen protector and the screen underneath was completely unmarred and residue-free. That's important, because the maker never claimed it is bulletproof. It can get scratched, it can even crack. It is glass, after all. What it does do is protect the screen so that what happens to the Bionic Shield doesn't happen to the screen underneath.To recap:1) If you get little bubbles (there shouldn't be many and they are miniscule), they will go away.2) Some things that look like scratches may actually be bubbles.3) The screen protector is not bulletproof. It will scratch and crack like glass, but your screen is protected.This screen protector is beautiful. It looks just like the phone's native screen.

Easy to clean, just wipe it off with your shirt and fingerprints are gone.  Microfiber is the best, but who brings one in his pocket anyway? Plastic protectors scratches easily, not this one.3) Installation.  No comparison.  No need to pull your hair out of frustration; you can install this with a tap of the tip of your finger.Tip:Watch the Zeetron online video for installation. Nice tips on placing the home button first which makes it a lot easier to align the screen protector.  Also see how the entire screen protector sticks to the phone with a single tap.Make sure you use the included wipes and microfiber to remove all fingerprints, grime and lints before placing the protector.Caution:There is a #1 and #2 plastic cover to protect the screen that you will need to peel off prior to installation.  #1 protects the side that has the adhesive so make sure not to touch it with your fingers.Price and value:At the time of this review, this sells for under twenty bucks.

Here's my take on this glass face plate for my iPhone:1.  Installation was a breeze, but you need to be sure your phone is clear of fingerprints and 'stuff' before applying the Bionic Shield.  It attaches to the iPhone in a flash!2.  Bubbleless -- I've fought those bubbles under plastic shields with every single one I've tried, and I thought that I'd have the same problem with the Bionic Shield.  Nothing of the sort.  Instructions tell you that any bubbles will be gone by the next day, and that's just what happened.  A bubble that appeared while I was installing the shield vanished by the next day.3.  Clarity -- This protective plate makes the iPhone much, much easier to see than the old plastic variety.Overall, I'm delighted.  No, I haven't hit it with a hammer, and I seldom (read Never) drop my phone, but I do put it through a workout carrying it around in my purse.  So far, I don't see the scratches and marks that have plagued me previously.If you've got an iPhone 4, you've made a big investment.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "I received the Moonstone 6000 as a 'for review' item but the vendor never asked for or even implied that a positive review was expected in return. And they didn't have to because a quality product that does what's expected of it and then it manages to exceed expectations can speak for itself. So here are my thoughts after trying it out.INNOVATION AND DESIGNThere's not a lot of room for originality when your product is a phone/tablet 'charger' but don't tell that to the Moonstone's designers. They managed to not follow the traditional 'smartphone' shape of most other chargers and packed their battery inside a nice, different shape. They call it 'parabola' and I'm not sure if this is translation for a Chinese word that better describes it but you can see it in the pictures at Amazon's page. It's very much in the shape of a Roku, only a little smaller and lighter.The status button is concealed and the status LEDs blink from under the Moonstone's skin so the only breaks in the stone's body are the one MicroUSB port used to charge the Stone itself and the two output USB ports used to charge your devices.THE EXPERIENCEThe makers managed to significantly reduce the dulness generally associated with a backup charger trough the innovative design and providing a choice of nice colors to pick from but that's not all. In the package there's a very nice charging cable as well and , believe it or not, TWO carrying bags, one felt with separate pockets for the Stone and the cable and whatever else and a larger nylon bag. I am impressed.But, wait, that's not all. When you order the Moonstone, that's not all you get. The box comes packed with little gifts. I don't know if everybody gets the same items and I won't list them all here because the surprise should be part of the unboxing experience but I will note that they are colorful and some do have a practical value - a mini stylus, a MicroSD USB card reader. Others are just 'pretty things' and some left us wandering what they were meant to be or do, which was fun.OPERATION6000 mAh should be enough to charge most phone at least twice. The stone has 2 charging ports, one for phones, the other for tablets and they are nicely labelled. The provided cable can be used to both charge the Stone itself or to charge your own device. There's not much else to say other than it works well. The device does not overheat while being charged and shuts itself off when it's done charging your gadget or after you unplug it. The 4 status lights will tell you when it's time to juice up the Stone.RATINGIt's 5 stars for the innovative design, flawless operation and all the nice and unexpected 'extras' that come with the product.

The Moonstone performs just fine along those lines, but what makes it stand out is the design. It looks far nicer than any other powerbank I've used &#8211; it&#8217;s squarish, but has beveled edges that make it very comfortable to hold. It can also easily slip into a back pocket.It can be stood up on edge so the ports face up, or laid flat depending on what works best for what you&#8217;re charging. It rocks a bit due to the beveled edges, but stands upright without a problem.The case is made of high-quality plastic with tight seams. I have the green version and it&#8217;s a vibrant lime green. It&#8217;s a glossy finish, but not a huge fingerprint magnet (although it does show some).The travel case is also a standout.

The pouch has two flaps so, in addition to the powerbank, it can hold cables, cords, etc. It looks great to boot!

It comes in a grey felt pouch that secures with an elastic band that matches the color of the battery.  When I took this out of my bag yesterday, I drew the attention of the people around me.  Few batteries get those kind of inquisitive looks.Of course, looks don't matter unless the battery performs.  The Moonstone has an energy efficiency rate (how much power can be transferred and not lost) that falls in the middle of the pack for power banks that I've tested.  It has two USB ports, one for 2 A charging (iPads), and a microUSB charging port.  The white, ribbon-style microUSB cable can be used to charge the battery and to charge microUSB devices.

If you want an extra emergency charge, with some left over, to your cell phone, get the smaller capacity one.

This is a very light and well designed charger that easily fits into a compartment pocket of your messenger bag or a suitcase. In an emergency it can even fit inside of a larger pocket. It comes with a micro USB cable, which can be used for charging of various Android smartphones, Kindle book readers, or any other device that uses micro USB charging cables. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with Apple's charging cables, so you will have to use your own or the ones bought from some other manufacturer. The micro USB cable can also be used to charge the Moonstone itself, but you will have to either rely on another charger or use your computer for this to work. Moonstone comes with a nice carrying bag, with pockets for both the battery and the cable.This is overall a pretty decent and nicely designed external battery, but it has its share of shortcomings compared to the other such chargers on the market right now. 6000 mAh is pretty much the low end of the capacity for such devices.

While this review sample is not the highest capacity one I have tested, it surely stands out for looks and bonus features. Mine is the apple green model and the color alone draws attention (not to mention the form factor).There are some excellent reviews that cover the physical dimensions and bonus items. I will not repeat that information, but do recommend that you read Ali Julia's helpful January 1, 2014 review. I will concentrate on how the capacity of this battery relates to various popular devices and a few aspects that I like:To put the 6000mAh capacity into context consider the capacities of these common tablets and phones, and you can easily compute the added use time this battery will provide:*Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.* Apple iPhone 4S 1440mAh battery with about 6 hours of use time.* Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.* Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.* Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.I love the attention to quality, For example, the flat cable that ships with this battery is top-of-the-line in construction and is tangle free. It's intended to charge the battery, but you can also use it to charge any device that accepts a micro-USB connector by switching it to one of the two output ports.The instructions are also clear and honest. An example is the disclosure of harmful substances used in this battery and the compliance or non compliance to standards for safe levels. I will not recite the entire table (ask in a comment if you want to know full details), but the only substance that exceeds S/T 1363-2006 standards is lead (Pb).Operationally, this has a fast mode and an ultra-fast mode, depending on which port from which you charge your device, The fast port has a single lightning symbol and the ultra one has a double symbol. The instructions do not specify whether or not you can simultaneously charge two devices from the two ports, but this worked on my Galaxy Note 3 phone and an iPad at the same time. Since both devices were over seventy-five percent charged when I tested the dual charging I do not know what the actual charging rates are from each port.Overall, this is not only a cost effective way to augment your tablet or phone's stock capacity, but it's also a green way. As you can see from the comparisons t common devices that I cited above, this will extend even the hungriest device to a full work day of use time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A battery that stands out from the pack", "unixReviewTime": 1394841600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2014"}

Otherwise, use the cable that came with your respective devices. There are 2 USB output slots, one 2100 mA indicated with 2 lightning icons and a 1200 mA indicated with a single lightning symbol. The higher current is for iPad and tablets and the other for your cellphones.The Moonstone battery pack is an excellent product both in function and simplicity.

Lerch", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "If you are looking for a well designed 6000 mAh external battery (power bank or whatever you want to call it), this is a great choice. It offers a stunning design, it is lightweight for a battery and comes with a lot of quirky, fun little extras to enjoy.For a longer review, the first thing you notice when you open the box the Moonstone is shipped in, things are... different. Different in a good way. Other power banks I have used skimp on packing to save money. For someone who enjoys the simple experience of opening a well packaged device, it's a bit of a let down in that regard for other devices, even if they live up to performance expectations.The Lepow Moonstone, however, is different. They've used all environmentally friendly packing material. The box is all cardboard, so simple recycling is available there. Then you pull the moonstone out. It's so well packed in a felt... bag (?) that is held shut with an elastic band. Before you get there though, there is an odd piece of wrapping around the felt bag that has to be removed. The paper felt odd to me, and wasn't easy to tear. I looked into it and they actually use DuPont designed paper that is 100% recyclable. It also lends an air of quality to the package that I haven't seen anywhere else for a power bank. The felt bag makes travel super simple.The other nice thing they've included is a flat USB cable. This means you can travel easily with the Moonstone and not have an oboxious cable that takes up too much space to travel with (unless you are like me and need that Lightning connector for the iPhone 5S). This cable can be used to charge the Moonstone or an Android or Windows Phone as is just a simple Micro USB cable.In terms of charging power, for an iPhone 5S at 6000 mAh and assuming 20% loss (efficiency loss is a fact of life with ALL batteries like this, not just the Moonstone so don't let that sway your opinion), you can charge an iPhone 5S about 3 times from the Moonstone if it is fully charged. If you have a Lumia 1020 like I do, that's about 2.4 charges.The Moonstone is lightweight and fits in a pocket or hand bag. It's a little annoying to carry in a pocket, but in a pinch you can carry it without much fuss.The other thing that is included in the package is a travel bag that includes a lot of little fun extras, including:Stickers24k Gold stickerSilicon Suction Holder (this thing is awesome - suction 1 side to the Moonstone, the other to the wall and it'll hang there)Micro SD USB card reader (cheaply made, but it works)Mini-stylus (I hate styli, but it's included and it works)Cord WrapHeadset wrap (easily wraps your earbuds without much fuss)Screen cleanerOverall:The well designed packaging, completely recyclable packing material, the capacity of the battery, the great design and the price compared to similar devices make the Moonstone stand out. Add on the little (but cheap) extras they included and you have a great price for a great device that performs well and travels easily.Highly recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.

On one hand - the company is a good honest company; on the other hand - the product cannot hold a charge and therefore cannot charge a phone battery. I reported to the company that the product was defective and that the item did not work.  So I was hoping for some sort of response or some sort of replacement for me to properly review it.

So I did a full charge on the battery before I actually attempted to charge it - I left it charging for at least 4 hours while I did my errands.  When I came back the LED was still on, then I attempted to charge my phone.  A few seconds later, it turned off.  I looked at the instructions and there didn't seem to have any mention of this.

It is nice to have a bit of emergency power if the phone runs out of power.  My second favorite use to have them along with my MP3 player when I am excercising, they don't wait much but they are are great solution for MP3 player which have recharble batteries that you can't take out (like my Sansa Clip+ and Zen MP3 players).  I don't have to stop listening when the battery is out.Artic 2200mAh external pack is 3.5\" long, 7/8\" in diameter, and weights 2.7 oz. The charger comes with 2 eight inch cables: 1 micro USB and 1 mini USB.  True to its name the battery pack remained very cool even when it was charging my tablet. There is a little light that indicates that the battery is charging (red) or has charge (green).The only negative I can say that the charge indicator does not stay on all the time (and there is no other charge level indicator), so it is hard to tell when the charger is out of juice without pressing on the button to see if it turns green or not.Even though its capacity is not huge, it charges very fast.  I tested this pack with Nexus Galaxy Phone and Galaxy 7.7 tablet with both a current monitor and using a 10 minute charging test. I also tested iPad Mini with a current monitor. I always run these test so I can compare different chargers to each other based on the results of the same tests.  This gives me an unbiased way of measuring how each external battery performs.If you are interested in the details of the tests I am including them below.  Summarizing the results I can say that it charged both my tablet and my phone quite fast, and measured up well against batteries of similar size and capacity.&#10152; How I tested this battery pack:======================To test this battery pack I used a current monitor. In addition to the current monitor I also used a 10 minute charging test which is less abstract than the measurements of current and voltage.I have been testing chargers and batteries for a long time and people often ask me why results on different ports of the same unit or similar units are different. The results are different because they are affected by a number of factors. To help with a numerical explanation of a differences I began using a USB current monitor which shows the voltage and the current flowing between the battery and the device.Most of the batteries are 5V devices and most devices show the voltage very close to 5V. If the voltage is higher it can damage a device and I will report higher than expected voltage if I see it. The intersting number is the current as it varies from port to port and from unit to unit. The amount of energy transferred from the charger to the device is calculated by multiplying voltage and current.The current varies based on what the device requires and what battery provides. This communication happens using different protocols depending on OS. Newer Android OS versions have adapted their protocols to get better performance from ports aimed at Apple devices. An addition variable that effects performance is whether a data cable or charging cable is used to charge the device. The charging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see the cable as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source.The 10 minutes test consists of charging each mobile device on each port of the battery pack for 10 minutes and measure how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. Since the charging speed is non-linear I start charging each device from approximately the same charge level. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; Test Results:======================&#10004; Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Charge at AC rate ~~~~~~ 3% change in charge in 10 minutesCurrent monitor: ~~~ 1.17A, 5.05V&#10004; Galaxy Nexus Phone~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Charge at AC rate ~~~~~~ 5% change in charge in 10 minutesCurrent monitor: ~~~ 0.93A, 5.14V&#10004; iPad Mini~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Current monitor: ~~~ 1.14A, 5.04VI received this power pack from the manufacturer for an honest review be it positive or negative.

At just 3.5 inches long by 7/8 of an inch wide, this backup battery is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack. This external battery comes with a micro and a mini USB cable.My son and I tested the battery using multiple devices and had much success as summarized below.Packaging was nicely minimal - a simple box with the unit, cables and instructions inside - and it was easy to open. If you would like to see pictures I took of this battery, please navigate to the battery pack's main sales page, scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section.Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our wall adapter (used my Samsung S3's wall adapter) and a red light came on; the User Manual indicates that the red light means the unit is charging, and that the red light goes out once the unit is fully charged. We let the battery charge until the red light went out, which took a couple hours to complete. This device does not have a digital display to keep you informed of its power level, and I do miss having such a display or indicator.Operating this battery is a breeze -- just plug it in to charge the battery pack, then when you need it you just connect your device to the port with the USB cable and proper fitting or with your device's USB cable. We tested both ways and had no issues at all with connectivity; once connected and charging a device, a blue light comes on to let you know that charging is proceeding.The storage capacity of this battery is 2200mAh which is perfect for a quick boost but it not for multiple charging use without recharging. It is just right to help out in emergencies, and the charging times we experienced were good; on average, it charged our units at a rate of about 1 percent per minute, or about 60% recharging per hour from its 5V/1A USB output port.We tested this power bank with a Samsung S4 and an HTC Droid DNA and both had the 1% per minutes charge rate. The battery pack actually got quite warm when charging the S4; I only had an oral thermometer handy that maxed at 106 degree max, so am not sure how hot the battery actually got. It was not comfortable to hold, but it continued to charge the phone without issue.The unit's micro fittings worked fine in all phones that we tried, and the regular USB charging cables that came with the phones all connected perfectly with the battery pack too.This battery is very easy to use and, though written in very small type, its user manual provides good information and easy to understand direction. The user guide and retail packaging confirm that there is a two year manufacturer's warranty and, if an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this unit gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.Affordable, portable, and did the job as described by the manufacturer. If you are looking for a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then I recommend it.Go for it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Arctic Power Bank 2200 Backup Battery - 1.0A Output - 2200mAh capacity - Blue - Works well", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"}

It showed exceptionally good behavior with iPad Mini and average performance with Galaxy Tablet.I received this power bank from the manufacturer for an honest review be it positive or negative. Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate.

I was pleased because this innovative design will allow the user to know exactly how much juice is left in the battery.  The LEDs are nice but as a rule, you'll only see three or four of them and the range of charge can be wide.  I'm used to working with these batteries and keep them charged up.  However, if you have one and only have 1 LED remaining, you may have a 1% charge or a 24% charge.  If you had a fuel gauge like that in a car, you might be driving on 1/4 of a tank or fumes.  Novel idea and I really liked it.I liked the promise of this battery, as well as the M2, until I started to test them.  I cannot speak for anyone else, but I test every battery I get ... in real-time circumstances.  I use my iPad a lot and when it's powered down sufficiently I start testing.  I figured a 6600mAh battery would be able to do a sufficient job powering up an iPad with a 46% charge remaining. The M3 struggled from the start with an immediate drop in charge from 97% down to 65% in fifteen minutes.  It was then I decided to watch and record very closely what was going on.A casual approach is usually my thing, but instead of a stellar performance I'd expect from a 6600mAh battery pack, I only got an average one.  Bolse is usually a performer, but for some reason the M2 and M3 battery packs fell a bit short of my expectations.  The performance was OK, but nothing more.  If you want a Bolse, which is an excellent brand, I'd look at the AON series, which really performed spectacularly.

The latest (and probably not the last) is the Bolse M3 6600mAh Dual Port External Battery Pack. Like every other Bolse external battery I've used, the M3 is an excellent combination of looks, weight, capacity, and features.The 6600mAh capacity puts it in the mid-range of battery packs you'd normally find. The M3 has two ports for output, with one powered for a normal smartphone charge and the other powered for charging an iPad. Or, if you want to be popular with your friends, you can charge two smartphones at once. Charging the battery pack is done with a normal micro-USB cord (included), and the cord is also used for the included plug adapters (Apple 30-pin, mini-USB, and normal Blackberry/Samsung/Nokia/other smartphones). There's a velvet pouch included that will hold the cord and adapter plugs so you can keep things in one place (the plugs could easily become scattered).Like the Bolse M2, the M3 has a digital readout on the front to indicate how much power you have remaining. I find this feature incredibly useful, as it takes the guesswork out of interpreting whether one LED bar means 2% or 22% power left.

In addition to a 8000mAh capacity, it offers a digital readout of the charge level left, a dual bulb LED flashlight, a laser pointer and a UV light.The size is excellent considering the capacity. It's only 1.75 inches wide, 4.5 inches tall and 1 inch thick. That's quite compact for a 8000mAh battery. It weighs 6 ounces.In the listing the description says the case is aluminum. To me, it feels like plastic. That's not a bad thing since the case is fine as-is, with tight seams and a nice feel. But, it does not feel like aluminum.The end is flat allowing this to stand up without any wobble. The edges are rounded so it's easy to hold and carry.All the ports and lights are on the top end. It has 2 USB outputs (1A and 2.1A). The labeling could be better, but it's decently legible. All the lights are controlled by the single side button: 2 clicks and the flashlight comes on; 2 more clicks for the UV and 2 more clicks for the laser.Rather than an LED gas gauge, it has a digital readout. The screen is behind the case which makes it a little blurry, but still legible. I find the digital readout to be far more useful than a series of LEDs since it tells me exactly what's left in the powerbank.No problems with operation other than the button. It would occasionally stick unless it was pressed exactly on center. There is also a small amount of battery rattle (e.g., the internal battery moves a small amount if you shake the powerbank). Neither are huge problems, but collectively they drop my rating by one star.This has more features than any other powerbank I've used. While the UV light is not all that useful (other than for fun), the flashlight and the laser pointer are useful to have. Plus, the size-to-capacity ratio is excellent - it's a very easy way to carry around enough spare power for a full tablet recharge or a few phone recharges.

I've tested it with iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, and Galaxy S3 and the battery performed as expected with all of those devices. The battery takes about four to five hours to fill up completely, and it charges my iPhone in about two hours. Ideally you would leave a battery like this one to be charged overnight.The battery is very compact and it fits comfortably with all of your other gadgets into a messenger bag for instance. It can even fit inside a large pocket, but I would not go around with it like that. It comes with a small USB micro cable that can be used for charging of the Android smartphones for instance. Unfortunately, it doesn't include Apple charging cables and you would have to provide your own.This power bank comes with several extra features, some of which are more useful than others. It has a nice LED screen which lets you know the precise amount of power that is left (from 0 to 99%). Most power banks, if they bother with something like this, only give you the power remaining in quarter of a capacity increments. A more precise gauge can really come in handy when you are traveling.The other extra features I am much less enthused about. The power bank comes with a an LED light, a UV light, and a laser pointer. I have never reached for a power bank to be used as an LED flashlight, have no use for the UV light, and as a laser pointer this power bank is way too bulky. You might have different experiences/expectations, but as far as I am concerned these are not the strong selling points of this power bank.The two extra features that would actually be really useful in a device like this are: 1. Built-in micro USB/thunderbolt cable, 2. Built in power outlet prongs. These two features would ensure that you never have to worry about carrying all the extra cables with you.

This one packs 8000mAH into a single battery, enough for a few charges of an iPhone or a single charge of an iPad.  There are two USB ports, one of which can supply 2.1A and the other which can supply 1A.  The 2.1A output is able to charge the iPad just fine (actually even the 1A output was detected as able to charge the iPad, but I presume it was slower).  The battery charges from a micro-USB connector.A few nice features differentiate this battery.  First, there is a red 2-digit 7 segment display inside the plastic.  When plugged it, it will read the battery power remaining, allowing you to see how much charge you have left (up to 99%).  Second, the power button cycles between a few on-board utility functions like a two-LED flashlight, a single UV LED counterfeit money detector, and a red laser diode.  All of these functions seem to work quite well.I only dinged the battery one star because I want to call attention to the presence of the red laser diode.  There is no visible warning label about the possible danger of laser light to eyesight which is a real concern.

The ZEEES KRAKEN is a nice carry-able size for emergencies. In fact, this entire unit is simply 'made' for emergencies.The 8000 mAh is not a lot of power - it is enough to charge an iPhone or similar about 1.5 times fully or an iPad once. If you are short on power on two devices you do have the option of charging both, but at the cost of power. The two USB ports are 1A and 2.1A providing the appropriate power to the units you want to charge in an emergency. Of course, you can also use the included Micro-USB cord to charge the unit as well as charging your devices, in case you are out of usable PC USB ports.The size is about 4.5&#34; X 2&#34; X 1&#34;, which makes it very portable. It only weighs 6 ounces which means you can put this in your pocket or briefcase easily. The finish is a glossy white and when you press the side button once, the power shows up in RED on the top surface in percentage points up to 99%. This is a great feature instead of guessing whether it's at 25%, 50%, 75% or more with little blue dots.The button also serves other emergency (if a bit of an overkill) services. Pressing the button twice alternates between a bright red laser light, a white double LED light for finding things in the dark and an odd blue UV light that detects counterfeit currency. I thought I'd leave that up to the banks.Looking at the price, it averages about what you might pay for the power and the two USB outputs.

To be honest, it also has some features that had me scratching my head.I mentioned that this is a mid-range capacity pack. At 8000mAh, it provides sufficient back-up for moderate users who have both a smart phone and a tablet. I tested this with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and a Samsung Tab 3 10.1, and it extended their combined use times by a good three hours of heavy use. I rarely bother plugging the Note 3 into a pack because it does fine for me with its large internal battery,  but the Tab 3 is a bit power hungry and had I only plugged that into this pack it would have come close to probably four to five hours of extended use for that device alone.This pack also worked wonders with an iPad and iPhone 5S combination with which I tested it. The iPhone seems to drain rather quickly, but this easily increased that phone's use time by a factor of two - with time to spare.One of the best features of this pack is it displays the percentage of remaining charge to the nearest whole digit. No guessing with LED bars (on packs that even have them): you know at a glance how much battery charge is remaining at the push of a button.On the topic of buttons, the single button on this pack cycles through a flashlight, an infrared pointer and an ultraviolet light. Frankly, the UV light had me scratching my head, although scorpions glow green under them and we have an abundance of those around here. The flashlight is a nice convenience because the form factor is similar to a rectangular light, and the IR pointer is probably useful in a business setting. They are nice features, but to me not as important as the charge indicator or the dual port design of this pack.A final note. The rated capacity of 8000mAh may not mean much to non-technical folks who want a battery pack to extend their use time, but do not care about specs. Here are a few common phones and tablets and their internal battery capacities and normal use times. Use those figures to get a feel for how the capacity of this pack will extend the use time of your device:* Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.* Apple iPhone 4S 1440mAh battery with about 6 hours of use time.* Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.* Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.* Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.As you can see, this would more than double the capacity of a Tab 3 10.1 or increase that of an iPhone 5S more than five times. However, all packs have some loss, so, for example the Tab 3 would probably get another six to six and a half hours use, and the iPhone 5S would probably get around a thirty hour boost, depending on how you use the devices. Regardless, this is a convenience that works as advertised and can significantly extend the use time of your phone or tablet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding basic powerpack with extras", "unixReviewTime": 1393632000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2014"}

I attempted to contact that vendor via email to address my concerns (twice!), but I never heard back from the representative who initially inquired about me writing this analysis.Thus, I want to point out a few things before I begin; the first being that, after reading a few other reviews, the primary issue that plagues this unit is definitely a defect and not a feature. The second is that I am advising you of the problems that I experienced so that you may come to your own conclusion about the merits of this evaluation and thus decide whether you wish to purchase the ZEEES KRAKEN 8000mAh Premium Portable High Capacity Dual-Port Power Bank (or the ZKPB, for short)Construction and AccessoriesThe ZKPB is a small power bank that is encased in heavy plastic and comes with an 8&#8221; micro-USB to USB charging cable. Curiously, the silver plastic that divides the white portions of the unit and caps either end feels lightweight and almost &#34;cheap&#34; as compared to the sturdier material that comprises the top and bottom halves of the casing. When you press the power button on the narrow side, the digital display will light up on the top (the white side that has &#34;POWER BANK&#34; written upon it); it is curious to note that the numbers are underneath the plastic, rather than having a display window cut out. Thus, when the unit is turned off you cannot see the numbers at all.By pressing the power button twice in rapid succession, you are able to cycle through a bevy of additional features that are available on the side of the unit with the two USB charging ports (left-to-right they output 2.1A and 1A). These &#8220;perks&#8221; turn on from right to left, in order:1) Flashlight: a surprisingly bright flashlight to help you to safely plug in your device/the ZKPB&#8217;s charging cable, or as a handy light source.2) UV Light: can be used to verify that you do not have counterfeit money (check for currency strips and/or markings) and/or activate other UV-sensitive security markings.3) Laser: a red laser light, so that you can use the ZKPB as a laser pointer for an impromptu presentation or as a way to torture/exercise your cat.PerformanceThis is where I had issues with the ZKPB that was sent to me. Whenever I had the ZKPB turned on, regardless of whether I was using it to charge a device or just testing out the other features available, there was an annoying high-pitched whine that would eventually start and wouldn&#8217;t stop. Still, determined to test the charging performance of the ZKPB, I soldiered on and just stuck the power bank and my phone in a closet and checked on them every half hour or so.Finally, I took the unit out and took note of the charge levels. Unfortunately, nothing had changed. That high-pitched white must be indicative of a short in the wiring. Gritting my teeth, I plugged in my cell phone and hooked it up to the ZKPB. At first, my phone showed that it was being charged. Then, that high-pitched whining started to emit from the ZKPB, and the icon showing  that my phone was receiving power turned off; in fact, so too had the digital display on the ZKRP. As soon as the whining stopped, everything turned itself back on, and my phone resumed charging like nothing happened.In the EndAs you can see, I cannot comment on anything other than the aesthetics of the ZEEES KRAKEN, and as far as that goes, I say 3 out of 4. Two days before I posted this review to Amazon, I again emailed them to ask if I could get a replacement unit, and again, no reply. So, dear readers, I am being honest and posting my opinion of the product. I am also going to print this opinion with a letter and mail it to the address that I have for their company, to encourage them to stay on top of their test pieces.Finally, I am sorry that I cannot provide any further information about this product&#8217;s performance!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Do NOT Release ZEEES KRAKEN!", "unixReviewTime": 1400889600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2014"}

The edges are all nicely rounded, and there are no protruding sharp edges to catch on anything. The black case is a fingerprint magnet, but that really doesn't bother me all that much.* It seems to have about the battery capacity claimed. It charged my iPhone4 from 4% to 100% while its stated capacity went from 55% to 44%. It also took about 10-12% of capacity to charge my Kindle (the old ones with the keyboard). The units battery capacity meter seems a little inaccurate around the lowest and highest 10%, so I don't know that you can extrapolate the results to say you can get 8 or so charges, but I have gotten at least 5 full charges of my iPhone and/or Kindle and had 30% battery left. I was able to charge both my Kindle and iPhone at the same time. If the Juice Box is fully discharged, it takes about 7-8 hours to fully charge it.* The Juice Box has a small flashlight, which I guess is sort of a requirement now, but which I hardly every use.  It is not all that bright in any case. The display is backlit, and easily readable in most any light. I am not sure it is really all that much more useful than the typical 5 bars of LED's, but it does make it seem more high tech.* There are two output USB ports, and their capacities are molded into the case. Good luck reading them, I couldn't. Not a big deal, since the display also tells you which ports are drawing power, so you can determine the high and low current outputs.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* My iPad (2nd generation) does not like this battery pack. The full 100% of the Power Box only moved my iPad from 15% to 43% charge. I don't worry too much about this, since no external battery pack has ever played well with my iPad, and many won't even charge it at all. No idea if that is normal, or if my iPad has a out-of-kilter charging circuit. Not a big deal, since the iPad seldom leaves the house anyway.* The instructions are laughable (literally). You will never learn how to use this device from them. Luckily it is quite obvious, but may be an issue for a technophobe.* The unit ships with a charging cable, which is a standard USB cable on one side and a series of adapters on the other. I have never been a fan of these types of cables, and just substituted the appropriate dedicated cable. The unit ships with a nice (fake) leather carrying case-although to be honest I don't use it because it makes the unit much harder to fit in my pocket. Note that the unit does NOT ship with a USB wall transformer, so you will need a power source.=== Summary ===* I have a number of these power packs, and this one is one of my favorites. It is small enough to carry in a pocket, but has enough power to get me through a two or three day trip.  I don't have the equipment to verify the 10,000 mAH capacity, but it is certainly enough to get a few charges for both my iPhone4 and my Kindle, which is all I really care about. The unit seems reasonably well constructed, although there is a slight internal rattle.=== Disclaimer ===I received this unit as a sample directly from the manufacturer. I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the manufacturer or any of its principles.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Performs well, except for MY iPad", "unixReviewTime": 1394841600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2014"}

Add the sleek, smart black and chrome finish, the twin ports, the flashlight&#8230;I&#8217;m hooked. Then toss in the LED data readout screen, and I&#8217;m officially blown away.OXA&#8217;s Juice Box S2 shares a lot of similarities with the S1 when it comes to the glossy look and even the flashlight: the former is a visual reason to pick this product out from the pack of other battery extenders, and the latter is a practical and smart deciding factor. By their nature, battery extenders are an intelligent add-on for anyone who uses cell phones, tablets, cameras, e-readers, and so on. But the flashlight is just plain smart: when the power goes out, and your landline phones die out along with the rest of the house, a flashlight makes darn good sense. This one is not very strong but, as I see it, it isn&#8217;t meant to be&#8230;it&#8217;s meant to get you around when the power is out, and that&#8217;s really it.The Juice Box&#8217;s real plus is the LED meter on the front that signifies the amount of power remaining in the battery; I found that to be a great addition. I know that, logically, a four- or five-light meter system essentially does the same, but I personally find that the meter, which displays the percentage of power remaining, is much more reassuring and informative.Again, there are two output ports (one at 1 Amp and the other at 2 Amps) along the right side of the Juice Box (depending on one&#8217;s orientation) and there is an input port for charging located between them. You should note that, with 10,000mAh of battery potential, it takes the Juice Box a LONG time to charge (more than 6 hours)&#8212;if there were one &#8220;wish&#8221; I could have granted, it would be that there would have been a more powerful charger included. But that isn&#8217;t a real complaint, as there are not too many times one has to charge it from a fully depleted state. My only other complaint is that there is no way to set the flashlight &#8220;up&#8221;&#8212;in other words, to point it at something without your hand holding it. This is a small note, hardly a real complaint, even.All in all, this is a terrific device, and it is one that I have no qualms about recommendation. As I said in regard to OXA&#8217;s Juice Box S1, just think of a loved one whose power&#8212;and landline phone&#8212;suddenly goes out in the midst of a medical problem&#8230;how much would you have given to supply him or her with more than adequate cell phone battery power&#8230;enough for several cell phone charges, in fact? To my way of thinking, this is a very small price to pay.TWO NOTES:Note 1: OXA guarantees its products for one year, and another six months if you call them to extend it.Note 2: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You Get a LOT of Battery at a Great Price", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}

The little LCD has the same poor viewing angle and sensitivity to temperature.  It's best with the unit tipped back a bit from you, then fading out the more vertical it sits. Ok, two complaints.

Fowler", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I&#8217;ve owned and tested a lot of battery pack and have not always been as enamored with the digital display type as some other people. One of the problems I frequently encounter is a very heavy drop in power in the first fifteen minutes. Yes, the OXA 10000mAh did drop in power, but not appreciably so. After the expected drop, it continued to perform quite well. I don&#8217;t run all kinds of tests, but rather run an informal one. I take a first generation iPad, usually with a somewhat depleted battery, to see how well it performs over time.One very interesting feature is that on the digital display, which indicates the percentage of power left in the battery, also indicates which port you are using. For example, I&#8217;m using the 5.0V 2.1A port. This is an important thing to know if you want an optimum speed charge for your device. For example, you won&#8217;t need as much juice for your phone and may wish to use the other port. These are individually labeled, but a bit difficult to see in some lights.A single tap on the button on the flat side above the OXA logo will light up the digital display. Two quick taps will turn the small flashlight on or off, whichever you prefer. The light obviously won&#8217;t light up a room, but will enable you to get around easily if the power goes out. There are four converters, but as a rule I prefer to use the cords that come with my own devices.What it all boils down to is how well the OXA 10000mAh performed. With 10000mAh you can fully expect to charge up a tablet readily, provided it&#8217;s not severely depleted. Overall I was quite satisfied with the performance, something I really didn&#8217;t expect. There are Samsung Digital cells and a premium chipset, which may have made a big difference. The only quibble I have is simply cosmetic. Black is a print magnet and there was a slight bubble beneath my digital display cover, however, I&#8217;m going to use it to charge my devices, not admire it.START:The iPad: 15%The OXA 100%15 minutes: 21% (OXA 87%)30 minutes: 28% (OXA 84%)45 minutes: 34% (OXA 82%)75 minutes: 49% (OXA 60%)90 minutes: 54% (OXA 50%)105 minutes: 60% (OXA 30%)120 minutes: 66% (OXA 24%)135 minutes: 73% (OXA 17%)150 minutes: 78% (OXA 8%)165 minutes: 84% (OXA 4%)180 minutes: 90% (OXA 2%)195 minutes: 95% (OXA 2%)205 minutes: 96% (OXA 0%)FEATURES:&#9658; Samsung Grade A cell and premium chipset ensure high quality&#9658; Above 500+ recharge cycles over the life of the battery&#9658; Digital screen to display the battery status when charging&#9658; 2 USB ports allows to charge 2 devices at the same time&#9658; Built in LED flashlight provides light when you need itSPECS:WHAT&#8217;S IN THE BOX:&#9658; Power bank&#9658; Micro USB wire&#9658; 4 x Phone converter, including 30-pin&#9658; User manual&#9658; Travel pouchSPECS:&#9658; Model: OXA 10000&#9658; Cell type: Li-Polymer battery&#9658; Capacity: 10000mAh&#9658; Input: 5V 1.5A&#9658; Output: USB1: 5V 1A; USB2: 5V 2.1A&#9658; Size: 4 1/8&#8221; x 2 2/8&#8221; x 7/8&#8221;&#9658; Net Weight:CERTIFICATIONS:CE FCC RoHsCOMPATIBILITY:Apple iPhone 5, 4S, 4, 3, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 1, 2, 3; Nexus; HTC One, Sensations G14 XE XL, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10; LG Optimus; PS Vita, GoPro; Nokia N9 Lumia 920 900 / Blackberry Z10 / Sony Xperia Z; ZTE; T-mobile, VerizonSample provided for review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The OXA was unexpectedly a solid performer ...", "unixReviewTime": 1390435200, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2014"}

In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's capacious, effective, versatile and well designed. It's one of the largest external batteries that I've come across in terms of capacity (with impressive 10,000 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than most of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, Kindle Paperwhite, Mobee Magic Bar, Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generation iPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged OXA battery. I was also able to charge my iPad completely, and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around. If there was an easy way of connecting this battery to an ultrabook I would not be surprised if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as well.The battery comes with a micro USB cable that allows you to charge it by either connecting it to a computer or a stand-alone USB charger. The battery looks stylish and elegant. There is no doubt in my mind which device the OXA designers paid a lot of attention to details with this battery.There are a couple of design features that would make this battery pack even more appealing to me. I wish it had retractable prongs that would allow it to be directly charged from a wall socket. Even more so, I wish it had an attached micro USB cable, or even better a Lightning cable. Unfortunately, this would probably significantly increase the price of such a battery (especially when the Lightning cable is concerned), but such a battery/charger would indeed be a perfect on-the-go power supply.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful Compact Battery", "unixReviewTime": 1398384000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2014"}

That means no guessing from 20%, 40%, 80% or whatever. You know exactly how much power is left. I prefer this much more than a power bank that has, let&#8217;s say, four LED lights that represent 25% each. With this battery, you know exactly how much power you have and how fast you are using it up.I would suggest looking at all types of power banks/battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. Also, check the prices on all batteries and the power! This will make things a lot easier in charging any external battery. I like this power bank more than any other I own simply for its small size and big power.

It is, however, high capacity and functional. When my review sample arrived it looked more like a desktop size MP3 player than a battery pack. Since the product specifications cover the dimensions and capacity I will not repeat those.My take on this is that it's about mid range in capacity (believe it or not there are packs that are double this one's capacity on the market), but rock solid and priced well below the ultra-high ones.I love the display that shows at a glance the remaining power, as well as the integrated protection. This battery has circuitry that will prevent over charge, over current and short circuit protection. I paid a small fortune for both my tablet and phone, so this set of features increases the value to me.While I literally had to read the instructions with a magnifying glass (a peril for we senior citizens) they were clear and contain information that would warm the heart of any geek. For one thing, there is a formula that every manufacturer should include with these. I will provide it at the bottom of this review because some folks hate math. I will say that the TRUE output capacity of this battery is about 6600mAh. Compare that to these numbers of actual device capacities and use times of some popular phones and tablets:Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.Even without using the formula it's easy to see how much extra use this pack adds. I mentioned in the title that this is excellent for first responders as well as power users (or campers, hikers, etc.) One feature is the large blue lit display that shows the percent remaining power. In an emergency that alone can make a difference by showing the time on scene of connected devices. The flashlight that is integrated into the case is another feature in that scenario. It's not particularly powerful, but could make a difference in some situations.The bottom line, though is the price. If you toss out everything I love about this pack it's still a value and that is the real reason I awarded it five stars.If you are interested in the formula I mentioned in the review:(battery supply voltage x battery capacity) x 0.9/battery output = the approximate output capacity.This accounts for losses through heat, wear and other factors (the 0.9 coefficient). Do not despair if this makes your eyes glaze.

Charging my Nexus5's standard battery by 70% used up 37% of the powerbank's self-reported capacity.Besides capacity, the killer feature here is the LCD readout. Rather than 3-4 LEDs offering an approximation of remaining charge, a backlit LCD shows the precise remaining charge. The reading seems accurate, although when powering on, the powerbank can take a few moments to display an updated charge level (or needs a load to be attached for charging before updating the capacity readout).Unfortunately, I found the powerbank retained charge very poorly, making its high capacity less useful. After being fully charged and stored at room temperature, the battery was down to 47% after only 3 weeks. A li-ion battery ideally shouldn't loose more than 1% of its charge daily.The hard plastic shell is likely part of why this unit doesn't weigh much, but it's a magnet for finger-prints. Despite judicious use of the included microfiber cloth, it quickly ends up smeary and unattractive.

My son and I tested these adapters using multiple devices and had much success as summarized below.Packaging was simple - a form-fitting plastic tray with the accessories wrapped in their own plastic bag - and it was easy to open. Even though this battery pack has an amazing capacity - 10,000 mAh - it is still of very convenient size (approx 4.25 inches long x 2.8 inches wide x .9 inches thick) and weighs just 7.9 ounces.To see what it looks like, please navigate to the battery pack's main sales page and look for the pictures I uploaded. The pictures may be found on that main page by scrolling down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section.Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our wall adapter (used my Samsung S3's wall adapter) and let it charge until 100% full which took about 4 hours to complete. The unit's digital display is outstanding; it is very easy to read with large, black LCD numbers which stand out nicely against its light blue background color.Operating this unit is a breeze -- just plug it in to charge the battery pack, then when you need it you just connect your device to one of the ports with the USB cable and proper fitting (or just use your device's USB cable -- that works perfectly too). Its ease-of-use is a good thing because the \"Manual\" that comes with it is so small, and written in such broken English, that it really is not usable. Good thing is that I relayed this to OXA via email, and already received a reply that they are working diligently to improve the manual. I think that OXA's customer service philosophy is top-notch.The storage capacity of this battery is outstanding and the charging times we experienced were flat out impressive. We tested it with a Samsung S3, HTC Droid DNA, Samsung Illusion, Samsung Reality, iPhone 5C, a Kindle Paperwhite and a Kindle Fire... and a typical example was when the Samsung S3 was boosted from 17% to 99% in about 20 minutes using the 2A port. Charging times using the 1A port were about twice that of the 2A port, but that makes sense and still the times were equal or better to what we get through our wall outlet adapters.We drained the Samsung S3 three times and recharged it with the battery, never needing to recharge the battery itself... it still had 37% showing on the digital display even after all the use. As is typical, the phones did get a little warm during the charging process, but no warmer than if put on its own charger, and the battery pack did not seem to heat up at all. Other than the odd manual, the only issue we came upon was that the unit's micro fitting would work fine in all phones with that port except for the Samsung S3 -- but that really was not an issue at all as we just connected the phone's regular USB charging cable to the battery pack and it worked perfectly.The title of the item on the Amazon sales page includes \"18M WTY\" which seems to infer that OXA provides a 1.5 year warranty; the item's box also notes \"Like us on facebook... within 30 days from purchase and your unconditional warranty will auto extend to 18 months\". If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.

My statements here reflect that testing.This type of portable power for this price? What's not to like?

It has high capacity, stable and predictable operation, and good portability. It's not really pocket size but certainly goes in a briefcase or larger purse with no difficulties.With a 10000 mAh capacity, allowing for typical operational efficiencies, you get about 8000 mAh of actual charging. That will give one to one and a half charges to a tablet and about four charges to a smartphone (there are wide variations, of course, depending on the devices in question). I won't repeat some of the detailed tables present in other reviews, but I'll recap my experience and then discuss a couple of use cases, one of which I consider very important.On a one-amp USB charging circuit, the battery charges in about 12 hours, which is what I would expect. It's a &#34;long overnight&#34; charge, but it isn't something you have to do all that often.I then used the battery to charge my smartphone and a couple of auxiliaries (a small portable speaker, etc.). I used nothing but this charger and used my devices in my typical manner. The battery pack lasted exactly a week before being fully discharged. A week--- that's an amazing length of time, but consistent with what I would expect based on capacity. A week of charging with no need for an AC circuit--- think about that.Of course I didn't have a tablet and that would have discharged the battery pack much more quickly. But here's the real point. If you're going away for a long weekend or even up to a week where there's no electricity, you're covered, and 11 ounces of additional weight won't be a problem. (Such locations may or may not have cell phone service but that's another issue.) But there's something even more important.Suppose there's a hurricane or a big storm coming. Power can be off for days, although cell phone service is usually a high restoration priority. Get set by ensuring that this battery pack is charged. You'll have as much as a week before you have to worry about a dead phone. Think about how important this could be in an emergency situation. I wish I had had something like this when an earthquake a few years back knocked out power in Honolulu for something like 16 hours. You can bet I'm going to keep it at the ready from now on.The unit is easy to use with a small but informative LCD display (which turns off after a few seconds to conserve power) showing percentage of power remaining. These percentages are representative rather than exact but I found the display reliable enough in actual use. There are two USB outputs, rated at 2.5 amps and 1.5 amp. I had no problem using them simultaneously. There is also a quirky but usable flashlight function. It isn't a bright light but it will get you around in an emergency. There's one supplied cord which is a standard USB to micro USB. Other standard cables from your devices work with the unit.The only quibble is the instruction book, which is tiny and written in a version of English that no one can possibly understand.

Sure, you can have a car charger, but that will only cover one device. Maybe you have a USB charger with multiple ports, but that doesn't reach to the back seat and also limits you to charging items in the car. That is where the OXA Juice Box S2 comes in; not only can you charge smaller devices like your phone or iPod, but it handles tablets, too!ConstructionThe OXA Juice Box S2 (henceforth referred to as the JBS2) is a portable power supply that is made of hardened plastic. There is a digital display on the front that indicates the percentage of the charge that the JBS2 has remaining, as well as which of the ports are in use (e.g. whether the power is inbound or outbound). If you are looking at it from the front (the side with the LCD display), there is a power button on the right side of the unit; if you press it twice in quick succession a flashlight will illuminate on the left side of the JBS2. Two more clicks of the power button will turn the light off.Included with the JBS2 is a USB power cable with a receiver end designed to accommodate one of the four enclosed connectors: micro-USB, mini-USB, 30-pin Apple, and an iPhone adapter tip. Note also that you can use your own USB charging cable in addition to or in place of the one included with the JBS2.The port to charge the JBS2 requires the micro-USB tip. The two charging ports for your devices are (from left to right) 5V/21A and 5V/10A. Finally, there is also a cloth bag to use to store your OXA Juice Box S2.UseI will try to keep this simple by outlining my views in the form of pros/cons.Pros1. According to the instructions, this battery will last roughly three months between charges (with no use). I have had the unit about two, and I can attest that this is accurate. While that is not quite charge-it-and-forget-it, this feature is quite handy.2. When I used this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 from 5%, it only took about 22% of the battery charge of the JBS2 when it started at 100% charge. I continued using the device to charge my phone without recharging the JBS2. I was successfully able to recharge my phone from at least 40% to full three more times before I had to recharge the JBS2.3. While the unit is a bit bulky to carry in your back pocket as a battery backup, keeping it in a bag or backpack to charge your phone or tablet while out and about is a wonderful way to use this. Charging two items at the same time doesn't slow down the overall charging time for either device; while charging my Kindle Fire HD and my phone I noticed no significant difference.4. The interchangeable tips are wonderful in that you no longer need to carry a wad of cables around if you have a myriad of devices that require unique adapters.5. Recharging the JBS2 only takes about a half hour to an hour, depending upon the charge required. The only time that it took longer was after it had completely drained.Cons1. The adapter tips should not be left on or placed in a stressful position while connected to a device; they can bend and/or break easily. The micro-USB adapter tip especially seems to be seated in the plastic housing somewhat tenuously.2. While the storage bag included with the JBS2 is made of a nice quality of velvet, I wish that there was a separate pocket (zippered, if possible), to store the USB cable and adapter heads. Right now you can push them into the bag, but I worry about them falling out or being crushed in my bag if I am not careful.OverallI have found that the OXA Juice Box S2 is indispensible. It is durable, and while the adapter tips aren't as rugged as I would like, the ability to interchange them to handle the different charging needs for my devices is very convenient. When you include the fact that The JBS2 is capable of multiple charges for your devices before it needs recharged itself, and it has a handy display that tells you exactly how much juice is left, I can say that I recommend this item to anyone who has a busy life. Or, anyone who is notorious in forgetting to charge their devices, like me!**Disclaimer: This charger was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

This is an ideal battery pack to take on two or three day trips, as it has a nice mix of power, weight, and features.It comes with two output ports at 1.0A and 2.1A, so you have the ability to charge one or two devices at a time. The input to the unit for recharging comes from a normal micro USB cord. For charging other devices, there's a USB cord and adapter plugs for micro USB, mini USB, 30-pin Apple connector, AND the lightning connector.  Finally, there's a built-in flashlight that turns on when you click the power button twice. You may never need it, but it's there. All this fits in the included grey velvet carrying bag, which means you have a better chance of not losing the adapters.The feature I'm getting more demanding of these days (especially on larger units) is a digital display of the power remaining. That gives you more precision on how much power is left, and the Juice Box has one. I also appreciate that it tells you which port/power output is being used. The embossed lettering on the charger itself is a bit hard to read, so this display covers for that issue.In terms of recharging speed... My iPhone 5S charged from 32% to 97% in just over an hour, so that's exactly what I would expect. When I unplugged the unit, my overall percentage of charge left was 84% (started at 100%), so I could probably get around four full charges before I'd have to plug the battery back in. The recharging of the battery was a bit slow, but if you left it overnight, it'd be back to full power in the morning.I'd be perfectly happy taking this battery pack with me on short business trips or weekends away from home. It wouldn't matter if you had time or a place to recharge the battery, and it would give you at least three or four days of phone use under normal circumstances.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good mix of features, weight, and power...", "unixReviewTime": 1399075200, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2014"}

The unit ships with a velvet-like bag, power cord and a few adapters. Quite frankly, I'll never use the extra adapters because everything I'd want to power with this runs off a USB cord; but I'm sure some folks will find the included adapter tips very helpful. The blue lighted charge indicator is a welcome addition over other lesser models, so you will always know how much charge is present in the power supply. The device also has a white LED light that puts out about the same amount of light as a cell phone flashlight app. Again, this is a feature I'll probably never use, but you never know when you might find yourself in the dark with nothing but your trusty Juice Box S2 to depend on for survival.I tested the S2 by attempting to charge my Galaxy Note 2 with the screen to maximum brightness while playing my favorite game, and the S2 was actually able to charge my phone about the same rate as my OEM charger does. Even with my phone charging, there was plenty of amperage available to my iPod Touch 4th Gen.The only complaint i have is that the S2 itself charges very slowly. The specs indicate that it only draws 1 amp, while it puts out as much as 3.1 amps. This means that theoretically it could be drained in one third the time it takes to charge it back up. This failing really is the only thing standing between this power supply and a five star rating. Still, it does work well and it does what it claims, which is always the most important thing ti me when rating an item. A quick look on Amazon shows competing models to be priced at or above the S2, which is also important to take into consideration.All things considered, I think the S2 is easily worth the current $24 asking price (at time of review), and had I purchased mine for that price, I'd be quite happy with the product I received.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does What it Says", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}

This is the latter and at around ten bucks is a bargain if you are using one of the more power hungry phones like the iPhone 5S.Using the iPhone 5S as an example the 2600mAh capacity that this battery has will add about 150% to the use time of an Apple iPhone 5S, which comes in at 1560mAh. Conversely, it will probably not add more than two extra hours to an Apple iPad 2's internal 6930mAh battery.The above estimates are conservative and account for power loss from temperature changes, repeated battery use and other factors. Out of the box in a stable environment this battery should perform much better than my conservative estimates.Lower capacity is not necessarily a detriment because it is a viable (and small)  emergency source that will easily fit in a purse or pocket. In that context even a tablet user will find that it can add just enough juice to make a difference for a critical task. My reasons for awarding this five stars are:VALUE: at the time of this review this pack was hovering in the ten to twelve buck range, which is the price of two fast food lunches. Considering that it does provide a lot of use time to some of the power hungry phones on the market it's definitely functional. Do not forget that this is perfect for cameras and other devices, so it's handy on vacations, hiking and beaches.CONSTRUCTION: it's practically indestructible, with no real moving parts (although the input and output ports are exposed).VERSATILE: the included cable has removable ends and includes mini and micro USB ends, plus an Apple 30 pin connector for all but Apple's newest phones. It also provides a mini barrel connector end for other devices like a bluetooth speaker I own.

At just four inches long by one inch wide & high, and only weighing 2.5 ounces, this backup battery is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack.This external battery comes with a cord that has a fitted end, allowing its four adapters to be exchanged as needed. My son and I tested these adapters using multiple devices and had much success as summarized below.Packaging was simple - a form-fitting plastic tray with the accessories wrapped in their own plastic bag - and it was easy to open. If you would like to see pictures I took of it, please navigate to the battery pack's main sales page, scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section.Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our wall adapter (used my Samsung S3's wall adapter) and a red light came on; the User Manual indicates that the red light means the unit is charging, and that the red light goes out once the unit is fully charged. We let the battery charge until the red light went out, which took about 4 hours to complete. This device does not have a digital display to keep you informed of its power level, unlike its outstanding bigger brother the OXA S2 100000mAh battery, and I did miss having that display.Just like the bigger OXA S2 unit, operating this battery is a breeze -- just plug it in to charge the battery pack, then when you need it you just connect your device to the port with the USB cable and proper fitting or with your device's USB cable. We tested both ways and had no issues at all with connectivity; once connected and charging a device, a blue light comes on to let you know that charging is proceeding.The storage capacity of this battery is 2600mAh which is perfect for a quick boost but it not for multiple charging use without recharging. It is just right to help out in emergencies, and the charging times we experienced were good; on average, it charged our units at a rate of about 3/4 percent per minute, or about 45% recharging per hour from its 5V/1A USB output port.We tested this power bank with a Samsung S4, HTC Droid DNA, Samsung S3 and an iPhone 5C... and a typical example was when the Samsung S4 was boosted from 1% to 61% in about 80 minutes. One curiosity; the backup battery has a 2600mAh rating and the Samsung S4 has a 2600mAh Samsung battery, but the fully charged backup was only able to charge the S4 to 61% before being depleted. This may reflect that it was only on the power bank's third or fourth cycle and the load may move towards full capacity after a longer break-in period. We did not experience this with other devices we charged.The phones did get a little warm during the charging process, but no warmer than if put on its own charger, and the battery pack did get a little warm too -- but nothing odd or unusual at all. The unit's micro fittings worked fine in all phones that we tried, and the regular USB charging cables that came with the phones all connected perfectly with the battery pack too.This battery is very easy to use... and that's good, because its \"User Manual\" is small and written in severely broken English -- to the point of being very comical. OXA staff already replied to my inquiry noting that they are working to improve the manual, and I feel that their responsiveness and customer service philosophy is outstanding. However, I must share this one line with you from the back of the box: \"Warming: do not follow these instructions. may cause a fire, electric shock damage or other damage.\" I am sure that this meant to start \"Warning: Failure to follow these instructions....\"The title of the item on the Amazon sales page includes \"18M WTY\" which seems to infer that OXA provides an 18 month warranty; there is no further mention of the warranty on the item's box or \"User Manual\". If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this unit gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.Affordable, portable, and did the job as described by the manufacturer.If you are looking a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then I recommend it.Go for it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "OXA 2600mAh Power Bank - Portable External Battery Charger - Single Port - Good emergency backup to have", "unixReviewTime": 1394928000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2014"}

I have a Samsung Galaxy S2, and while an older model from the Galaxy line, it still sucks a lot of juice. When I am at home I can pop in my Bluetooth headset and leave the phone on the charger. More often than not, however, I tend to not realize that my phone is nearly dead until I am ready to walk out the door to run errands. Because I have lupus, I always make sure that my phone is on me in the event something bad happens; unfortunately most of my errands are close by, so the sporadic charging of my car charger just isn&#8217;t enough.That is where the OXA 2600mAh External Battery comes in.ConstructionThe OXA External Battery (OXA for short) is a compact battery that is roughly as long as an iPod Touch, fitting in the palm of my hand comfortably. It is a bar with a keychain dangling from the end with the USB ports. When plugged in to charge (it uses the micro-USB adapter), you simply plug it in to the corresponding port and plug the standard USB end into a USB charger (either through a computer, or if you have an A/C adapter, that works well, too). While it is charging a light on the white panel with the OXA logo will turn red; from being completely dead to a full charge takes about thirty to forty-five minutes. Once it is completely charged the red light disappears, and your battery is ready-to-go!UseUsing this battery is simple: once charged, the included cable has four different adapters (referred to as &#8220;Power Connectors&#8221; by the manufacturer) that connect to the end opposite the large USB plug. To change adapters, all that you need to do is pull the old tip off and then replace it with a new one. While these are nice, they are also easily lost. This battery does not come with any type of a small pouch to carry both the wire and adapter tips, increasing the possibility of them being lost, or worse, put into the mouth of a child or pet.The adapters that I received were one of each: micro-USB, Apple (most devices), a straight jack, and one that I cannot identify (it reminds me of the plug for a Playstation Vita, but is thinner). After you have chosen the desired tip for your device and connect it to the cord, simply plug the USB tip into the top port (the &#8220;outbound&#8221;) and plug the appropriate Power Connector into the charging port on your device. If properly connected, a blue light will shine on the front white panel; once your device is at a full charge, the blue light will turn off.ConclusionBeing able to stick this adapter COMFORTABLY into the same pocket as my cell phone and go about my day has been a blessing. This unit is lightweight, snazzy-looking, and efficient. It is small enough to fit into the pockets of a pair of jeans, a briefcase, a purse, and heck, even a lunch bag! This OXA Battery will prove itself indispensable, providing a boost of power for whenever you need it. Combine this great usage with the fact there are four &#8220;Power Connectors&#8221; to support up to four different charging adapters, and suddenly you have a handy little power pack that will keep you charged on the go without the need to pack several different cables!In short, if you would like an external battery to keep on-hand for those busy days, or just as a backup while running errands/camping/to free up a socket in your home, this is the unit for you. With a keychain loop you can connect it to a bag so that you won&#8217;t lose it. The only problem that the OXA External Battery has is the lack of a bag/carrying case for the adapters and the charging cable when not in use; while the various adapters are definitely a strong selling point, you will find yourself packing a separate Ziploc bag, and that is a bit annoying when you consider the quality of the product as a whole. Either way, this is a handy thing to have on hand and I can recommend it with confidence!**Disclaimer: This unit was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

Interestingly, the included USB cable has swappable connectors so that the other end terminates in anything from a micro USB connector to a 30-pin Apple connector. The one thing this device is missing is the new Apple Lightning connector.

{"reviewerID": "AAEVGE52KL0DJ", "asin": "B00E2YI052", "reviewerName": "Tim", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "This is the third mini / compact USB power supply I've been asked to review (two different manufacturers) and both OXA models are by far the better of the two.I recently reviewed a nearly identical OXA product and it is so similar in form and performance that the review of the first product easily serves as the review for the second product with only a couple changes to reflect my charging tests.While this power supply seems to live up to its description, it isn't the best fit for all charging applications, and shoppers should make sure they are buying what they actually need before deciding on what to buy. Let me explain...This mini power supply, like all I have seen in its class, puts out 5 volts at 1 amp and has a 2600 mAh capacity. First let me explain my use of the word \"seems\" in the paragraph above this one. Because I don't have a proper battery tester (the ones that accurately test capacity are in the $300 range), I can only give anecdotal testimony about the power output and capacity of a battery. Because I have an extensive collection of devices and a variety of batteries for my devices, I have a pretty good idea what \"x\" amount of capacity and \"y\" amount of amps output are. My best guess is that this OXA power supply meets or possibly exceeds the claimed power output by a small measure.Now, why do I say this power supply isn't ideal for every application? The answer is that many larger and high end devices consume much more energy than what this OXA product can supply. Two examples are my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and my wife's Kindle Fire. My Note 2 ships with a 2 amp charger and even that is barely enough to charge the battery if I'm using the phone as a GPS with the screen on full brightness. This OXA would certainly extend my usage time, but my phone would continue to discharge even while plugged into the charger. I did leave the phone connected to the power supply overnight with the screen off, and it did raise my battery level from 18% to 45% by morning, but my phone has a massive 9300 mAh extended battery, which explains why the power supply didn't charge it much.I plugged my iPod Touch 4th Generation into the OXA power supply and it took it from 3% to fully charged, while I was listening to the iPod over the course of a five and a half hour drive. At the end of the trip, my iPod was fully charged and the power supply still had some juice left. The reason for this is that the iPod has a much smaller battery and consumes a fraction of the energy my phone burns through.So before buying this OXA mini power supply, think about if it will do what you need it to. OXA sells a wide array of larger (and more expensive) power supplies, some of which I will be reviewing soon, and of course there are other manufacturers out there as well. I'm satisfied that this charger does what it claims, and it is (price at time of review $10.99) about half the price of competing models in the same size and power output classes. For me personally, because of my energy hungry devices, I probably would want a more powerful supply. If you're looking to charge an iPod or more energy efficient phone, then this model is definitely one you should consider.I didn't pay for my test sample, but had I bought this for $11 here on Amazon, I'd be very happy with the value I received. Most competing models in this class are selling for around $20 and may not live up to their claims (like the one I reviewed for a different manufacturer). All things considered, this little thing definitely deserves five stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Bang for the Buck", "unixReviewTime": 1393632000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2014"}

It is about the same size as a deck of cards, although a little bit thicker. It weighs 6.2 ounces. That makes it an easy fit for a shirt or pants pocket, meaning it is easy to carry around. Although the unit comes with a decent carrying case (large enough for the included cables and adapters), I find it easier to carry without the case.* There are to outputs, a 1A and 2A USB outputs, and a mini USB input for charging.

I was able to simultaneously charge both my iPhone and Kindle, although it did seem a bit slower.* The display is 4 tiny blue LEDs. While other units have a digital percentage display, I honestly don't think they provide all that much more information that just 4 lights.

There is a single switch, which either turns the unit on/off, or turns on the small LED slashlight.* I don't have a method of measuring power delivered through a USB cable, so the only way to estimate capacity is by what it charges. On one charge, I got a full charge (5% to 100%) on my iPhone4, and a full charge on my Kindle keyboard.* The case is a nice hard plastic, with no sharp edges to snag on clothing.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff===* I found the operation very intuitive. If you are not familiar with how these devices work, or would have trouble figuring it out, you will never get it from the enclosed documentation.

Imagine your wife, kids, or elders out on the road in bad weather when their cell phone batteries are running out&#8212;or worse yet, when a storm knocks their power out&#8212;and you&#8217;ll see why.When you pick up the OXA 7800mAh Juice Box S1 the first thing you tend to notice is that it&#8217;s a heavy product for its small size, which indicates the size of the battery within. It&#8217;s even a little smaller than a real Juice Box, but you can immediately feel its density.  The reason: not only can the S1 Juice Box charge two products at a time (one at 2A, the other at 1A), but it can charge a multitude of differing products from iPads to Kindles to Androids and GoPro cameras and more, AND it can charge many of the smaller ones more than one time. For instance, while it can only partially charge an iPod, it can charge a cell phone twice, or even a third time, depending upon how close to empty that phone was.The Juice Box is a beautiful glossy black box with very little to detract from its sleek, shiny exterior. Within a pretty blue circular disk on the upper front, four indicator lights tell you the device&#8217;s status when charging, whether the Juice Box is charging a phone, or being charged itself. It sports polished chrome-colored bands on the sides, and on the left side there is a thin slot that serves as the input for charging the Box. The twin ports for charging other devices are along the top, as is a small bulb which serves as a flashlight one can use whenever his or her house loses power: it&#8217;s a thoughtful addition to the battery extender for when power is out and these extenders become EXTREMELY important. It took a little finesse learning how to turn the flashlight on: it takes two pronounced taps on the center disc within the blue circle to turn it on, but those taps are not always easy to coordinate.I like the OXA 7800mAh S1 External Battery, as I do all of their products. OXA&#8217;s products are noteworthy for being well made and hardy (and having the worst-written directions this side of the Rosetta Stone). But in that vein I had one surprise here: the Juice Box S1 had one flaw that immediately dismayed me. When I took it out of the box, the blue metal circle on the front  that I just addressed was askew, pointed off in a direction that did anything but allow me to see the lights. Upon its removal and re-placement upon its correct perch (using the same adhesive that it came with), it seems the glue is holding, but time will tell.

I could be wrong, but I was unable to find another on Amazon that looked just like it, which I couldn't say for the higher capacityOXA Juice Box S2 10000mAh.  Style may not be over function in my book, but it's not something that I eschew.  As is my custom, I charged and drained the S1 5 times before doing any real trials, as it commonly recommended for battery packs.  When hooked up to a device, I measured the correct 1A and 2A output from the connectors, meaning this unit delivers as advertised.  Charge time was an average of 4 hours, (after the 5 cycles).  Like some of the better models, the S1 has automatic detection, delivering its juice as soon as you plug in a device.  This is something I prefer, as fooling about with on/off buttons seems archaic in this day and age.  I'm not sure why so many companies use gloss black bodies, and the S1 takes it's fair share of fingerprints, scratches, and scuffs when not handled with some care.  The little LED flashlight is so-so, enough to light your way in the dark if your eyes have adjusted, but pretty dim otherwise.  On a more sour note, the cables that came with the S1 were defective.  I could not get anything to work with them unless I applied a fair amount of force on the full sized USB end, cramming it into a USB port.  Other cables, my own and those that came with the S2 model, worked just fine.Given the (current) price of twenty-two beans, though a nice unit, I'd opt for the higher capacity S2 model for just two bucks more.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Beware the cables", "unixReviewTime": 1394236800, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2014"}

It also comes with 4 different power cords including a 30 pin connecter, lightning cables for connecting it to apple devices. It also comes with a micro USB cable for charging things like cell phones, Bluetooth speakers, portable hard drives and digital cameras and another connector that I am not sure what it&#8217;s for. It comes with a thick and soft velvet bag and a microfiber cleaning cloth that is good for cleaning the battery pack or screens of devices like tablets or phones.I got off to a rough start with this battery pack. The first time I plugged it in the USB cable shorted out and started smoking. Luckily my wall charger had a built-in safety that shut the power down. I tried several times to use the cable and it was ruined so I threw it away and used a different cable. If this was the first time that I had used an OXA product then I probably would have thought it was junk. However I have used several other OXA products and have really liked them and have had no problems so I think it was just a fluke and a bad cable. I will certainly keep a close eye on devices like this in the future and I will update my review if I have any additional problems.The battery pack itself looks pretty nice with its shiny black case and chrome trim. It has a power button on the front and it also has a small flashlight built-in. The flashlight can come in handy at night or in a dark car. It also has four blue LED light&#8217;s on the front that flash to indicate when it&#8217;s charging and illuminate and tell you how much charge is left in the battery. This battery pack has 7800 mAh worth of power which is just enough to fully charge my iPad 2.I have had no other problems with this battery pack since replacing the USB cable.

Then it has two regular USB ports for charging your devices. You can use the ports one at a time or use them both together. The 1A port is for smaller devices like phones and MP3 players. The 2A port is for larger devices, like iPads and Kindle Fire tablets. You can also rapid charge some devices on the 2A port. I use the 2A port to quickly charge my iPhone 5. It works great.This charger comes with a soft fabric pouch for your purse or travel bag. The pouch is big enough to hold the charger and the cable and four charging tips included (Apple, mini-USB, micro-USB, and something small and round that I don't recognize). You'll need your own wall plug to charge the battery or you can plug it into your computer if you don't mind a slower charge.

Fowler", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I&#8217;d never worked with any OXA products or battery packs until I worked with the 10000mAh battery pack. Until I actually work with any battery pack or give them one of my informal tests, I find it hard to pass judgment. Sometimes there are gems in the crowd, similar to books, and the OXA is one of them. Perhaps it has something to do with those Samsung Digital cells.The 7800mAh OXA battery pack really surprised me, but not as much as it could have because after testing the 10000mAh, I knew OXA was a quality brand. The simple LED feature is what most people come to expect, but some are now preferring a digital readout. As long as you make sure you fully charge your battery pack during the night, it&#8217;s not much of a problem.What I found with the 7800mAh OXA, was a battery pack that consistently added a charge to my iPad. I usually use a 1st generation iPad for testing for a decent comparison. The darn thing kept charging long after I figured it would have depleted its charge. I kept pushing it until there wasn&#8217;t any more juice at all. Superb performance and quite unexpected.A single tap on the button on the flat side above the OXA logo will light up the digital display. Two quick taps will turn the small flashlight on or off, whichever you prefer. The light obviously won&#8217;t light up a room, but will enable you to get around easily if the power goes out. There are four converters, but as a rule I prefer to use the cords that come with my own devices.What it all boils down to is how well the OXA 7800mAh was a real performer, an unexpectedly good one. With 7800mAh you can fully expect to charge up your phone up a few times or give your tablet a real boost. Overall I was quite satisfied with the performance, something I really didn&#8217;t expect. There are Samsung Digital cells and a premium chipset, which may have made a big difference. The only quibble anyone could have is that black is a print magnet.START:The iPad: 11%The OXA 100% (4 LEDs)15 minutes: 17% (OXA - 4 LEDs flashing)30 minutes: 23%45 minutes: 30% (OXA - 3 LEDs flashing)60 minutes: 36% (OXA - 2 LEDS flashing)90 minutes: 42%105 minutes: 48%120 minutes: 54% (OXA 1 LED flashing)150 minutes: 65%165 minutes: 71%180 minutes: 77% (OXA stopped charging)FEATURES:&#9658; Samsung Grade A cell and premium microchips ensure high quality&#9658; 4 LED lights work as charge indicators to show battery status&#9658; Compact and portable, convenient to carry in your bags or hand&#9658; 2 USB ports allows you to charge 2 devices at the same time&#9658; Fashionable, stylish and light-weighted design with flashlightSPECS:WHAT&#8217;S IN THE BOX:&#9658; Power bank&#9658; Micro USB wire&#9658; 4 x Phone converter, including 30-pin&#9658; User manual&#9658; Travel pouchSPECS:&#9658; Model: OXA 7800&#9658; Cell type: Li-Polymer battery&#9658; Capacity: 7800mAh&#9658; Input: 5V 1.0A&#9658; Output: USB1: 5V 1.0A; USB2: 5V 2.0A&#9658; Size: 3 7/8&#8221; x 2 1/8&#8221; x 7/8&#8221;&#9658; Net Weight:CERTIFICATIONS:CE FCC RoHsCOMPATIBILITY:Apple iPhone 5, 4S, 4, 3, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 1, 2, 3; Nexus; HTC One, Sensations G14 XE XL, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10; LG Optimus; PS Vita, GoPro; Nokia N9 Lumia 920 900 / Blackberry Z10 / Sony Xperia Z; ZTE; T-mobile, VerizonSample provided for review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unexpectedly superb performance for a 7800mAh battery pack ...", "unixReviewTime": 1390694400, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2014"}

The 7800 mAh capacity is sufficient to charge your smartphone three to four times. Depending on a model it can also be sufficient for charging your tablet computer. I have tested it with iPhone 4S, Galaxy S3, and the first generation iPad. I was able to fully charge my iPad and had no problem charging iPhone and Galaxy several times.The power bank has a micro USB port that allows it to get charged. However, it doesn't come with its own USB charger, so you are left to use one of your spare ones, or charge it by plugging it into a spare USB port on your computer.There are two regular USB ports on the front of this power bank. One supplies 1 A current and the other one a 2 A one. The lower one is usually used by smartphones, while tablets are charged via the higher one. However, these days either one of them can be used with almost any device. The only major difference will be the charging speed. Two USB ports also allow you to charge two device at the same time.Charging times will vary by the device, from just over an hour for a smaller device, to almost four hours for iPad. These times are more or less typical for external batteries/portable chargers that I have worked with. Charging of the power bank itself takes several hours, and is best done by leaving it plugged in overnight. There are a few small LED lights that tell you the total charge capacity remaining, which is a very useful feature.There are a couple of features that some other power banks come with which would have made this an even more handy charger. My favorite is a pair of built-in wall outlet prongs. The second favorite is the wrap-around attached micro USB charging cable. Inclusion of those two features ensures that (if you have an Android phone for instance) you never have to worry about bringing along any other cables or chargers with you.Overall, this looks like a quality product and so far I have had only the best experience with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Good External Power Bank", "unixReviewTime": 1391385600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2014"}

What is your comfort level?  What kind of situations might you find yourself in?  Are you going to get stuck on a highway?  Will you stand in line overnight waiting to buy tickets to your favorite band?  Do you do the Black Friday thing?  Do you take road trips, travel by air, spend days out in the wilderness?  Before investing in an external battery, you need to stop and think through your lifestyle and how often you might find yourself away from a wall plug.  Then consider your comfort level.  Then buy your battery.This is a dependable, well-constructed &#34;juice box&#34;.  It will give your phone enough power to keep talking for at least 25 hours, or keep you browsing for more than 35 hours.  You will get less time on a tablet.  And, keep in mind that the times I mention are not set in stone and vary with each individual's situation.It weighs 6.1 ounces:  A bit heavy for a pocket or evening bag, but fairly negligible in a purse or backpack.  This case is not heavier than others with comparable mAh.  All batteries are dense and are &#34;weighty&#34;; it is the nature of a battery.  And you just can't complain about it, 'cause the weight can't be helped.  But because of the weight, what you need to look for is a battery case that is smooth, with few or no blunt edges.  Look for rounded edges--as you'll find with this case--because rounded will be gentler than defined edges on material (like pocket linings, purse linings, the inside of backpacks and such.)  Rounded is easier on the hands (more ergonomically correct) and easier on whatever else is rattling around in close proximity to the case.This case also comes with drawstring, gray velour bag, which will help protect it and what's around it.  It also comes with four adapters for your different devices.The set of instructions that I received with my case has ridiculously small print that I can't even read with a good magnifying glass.  After contacting the representative for this line, he mentioned that the instructions have been fine-tuned and, hopefully, future customers will receive something readable and helpful.If you do buy this product, here is a tip I learned from my experience with it:  Until you fully charge it the first time, the four LED gauge lights that monitor and report charging status have a mind of their own.  Just out of the box the first time, it seemed that whenever I picked up / put down the case the lights came on.

The small size is great for packing and in all the power banks I have seen with this much power, the OXA is one of the smallest.This power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least. The power bank weighs a meager 6.1 ounces and measures only 0.9&#8221; X 2.6&#8221; X 3.9&#8221;.  It also comes with an emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful (Note: this uses power quickly) and a travel pouch. It is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device as the kit also includes a cord that that has one end as an USB plug and four different attachments to make it usable with just about any device.This bank also includes two ports for charging; simultaneously if wanted. One is a 5V/2.0A for Android and Apple devices and the other is a 5V/0.6A charge for most other devices.I like the blue push button flush on the front side with the power supply lights.  The power supply is shown with four blue LED lights showing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%.

This sleek-looking black plastic and silver metallic OXA 7800 mAh Juice Box external battery charger is a powerhouse that charges multiple types of smartphones and smart tablets by way of two outputs: one with a 5 volt, 2.1 mAh port for tablets and the other port with a 5 volt 1.0 mAh port for smartphones. The nomenclature of the ports, unlike some competitors, is clearly and deeply etched into shiny metal, which is an advantage under low light conditions. Similar to the dimensions of a pack of cigarettes, it weighs in at 6.6 ounces. The unit arrived with 50% charge and could have immediately provided power where necessary. Under extensive testing, this charger rapidly and simultaneously charged a number of different types of smartphones and tablets in separate tests. The power levels are denoted by four blue lights which indicate the unit is fully charged when all are lit. These are located on the top of the Juice Box with one button that activates both the charger with one push of the button and/or a small onboard flash light with two pushes of the button.With one full Juice Box charge, three iPhones were fully charged to 100% and a fourth reached 35% before the charger was empty. Charging simultaneously, an iPhone was charged to 100% and a tablet reached nearly 50%. Charging 2 iPhones, the 7800 juice box was one of the fastest external chargers I have tested, powering up two iPhones at a speedy average of 1 hour and 52 minutes, which is faster than charging directly through an Apple power head connected to a 120 volt wall socket and that time is within 9 minutes of `on board' battery charging cases. Over weeks of testing, the battery actually became more efficient in it's output. Cons: there are status lights instead of a numerical readout of the unit's power status,  so the user is never sure exactly how much power total power is represented by the lights, although general estimation is possible. Another Con is the user \"Manual\" written in very small font. But a definite Plus is the onboard flashlight which casts a narrow beam that nicely illuminates a five foot by three foot main area across a darkened room.

OXA has a whole line of them and I've evaluated some others (as in the other cases, I received a sample for review). All of them are quite good if you understand how you're going to want to use them.Let's start with the basics. Input: 7800mAh, allowing for about 80% efficiency, should charge up in just under 10 hours. I found this unit charges in about 9 hours, a little better than expected and quite reasonable. Output: 7800mAh will give a typical tablet one full charge and a typical smartphone about 3 full charges. My results are in accord with this estimate. I was able to charge my phone about 2.5 times as well as charge an external speaker twice. This is about right. There are two USB output ports, one at 2A and the other at 1A. These are suitable for use in parallel and will charge your devices in a reasonable timeframe. (I don't believe in fast charging unless absolutely necessary; the heat generated can be damaging to both the device and the battery pack.)The unit is small, relatively light, and quite portable. It goes readily in a large pocket or easily in a briefcase, purse, or backpack. It is supplied with a cable and four adapters making it usable with just about any mainstream device. There is also a nice velvety carrying case. The unit has a small &#34;flashlight&#34; that doesn't put out much light but might help in a pinch.The 7800mAh rating places this unit between the larger (heavier, bulkier) 10000mAh and up battery packs, and the smaller (lighter, pocket/keychain size) chargers in the 2600mAh class. What unit you choose depends on your intended use. Do you want something small that will just &#34;top up&#34; your phone once or twice during a working day? Or do you want something that will provide a week of emergency power?This 7800mAh unit will provide emergency power for a phone for 4 to 5 days, from my testing. This makes it very good for camping trips and the like, and also useful at home during a power outage, even a somewhat extended one. If you're concerned only about home use and only an emergency power source, you might opt for a larger unit. But if you want something that will combine home and away use, including long-weekend recreational trips, this one is an excellent choice.I have no trouble giving the battery pack a five star rating.

{"reviewerID": "A3V79KXIY09MOE", "asin": "B00E327OIM", "reviewerName": "Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "External batteries are becoming more and more of a necessity as society continues to plug itself in to the myriad of electronic gadgets out on the market today. As someone who is notorious for forgetting to charge her cell phone, having an external battery has proven to be quite useful. While I already know that OXA manufactures high-quality products, testing out this battery proved my faith in their manufacturing prowess. So, without further ado, here are my impressions of the OXA Juice Box S1 (henceforth referred to as JBS1).ConstructionI will keep this portion short and sweet: the JBS1 is roughly the size of a deck of playing cards, only thicker. The plastic casing is glossy with a black paint that has subtle sparkles in it. While not heavy, there is definitely a bit of weight to this battery that helps to demonstrate the manufacturing quality of the JBS1. As indicated in the product description, there are two USB ports on the narrow edge of the battery that are set next to a small light. One USB port is rated for 2 Amps; the other USB port is 1 Amp.The face of the product has a silver circle set within a blue circle; there are four lights in a row in the blue area. These lights are used to indicate the charge level of the battery and will flash to indicate how much &#34;juice&#34; you have left. The silver inner circle acts as a power button; while it is textured to prevent your finger/thumb from slipping. The button is not very tactile, so it is not always obvious that it was depressed; if you are successful the charging lights within the blue circle will light up to show their power level. In addition, if you double-click the silver button the small light on the narrow edge of the battery will turn on and act as a flashlight.PerformanceIn terms of its primary purpose, the JBS1 delivers in spades. Once the battery is fully charged, you can use it to recharge your device(s) multiple times before the JBS1 needs to be recharged. From a full charge I was able to use the battery to charge my cell phone overnight for three consecutive nights, as well as using it to keep my phone powered during a phone call when the battery got low, before I needed to recharge it. I was also able to use it to charge both my cell phone and my iPod at the same time without there being a significant drain on the charge!The JBS1 comes with only one charging cable (which is used to charge the battery itself, also); what makes this product nifty is that, included with the battery, are charging adapter tips that plug into the non-USB end of the cord. The two most common adapters, micro-USB and Apple, are included. That way you have the flexibility to charge different devices without needing multiple USB cables! When you factor the excellent performance and construction of the JBS1, you are truly getting a great value.Final SayIf you find that your phone or other electronic gadget is running low on power by the end of the day, this battery is very handy to keep charged (takes about four hours from it being completely discharged) and ready-to-go to keep your devices powered. While a bit bigger than a deck of cards, the OXA Juice Box S1 will fit into your pocket, but may be a little bulky to carry. For this reason I recommend using this battery if you are going to be in the same area for a while.The only complaint that I have is that the micro-USB adapter tip had a little bit of play to it; sometimes I had to jiggle it a little for my phone to detect that it was there and for charging to commence. Overall, though, I never had any problems with any of the adapter tips that were included with the battery. Plus everything was nice and neat to store in the velvet pouch that is included with the JBS1. The only change that I would make to the pouch is to have a separate, zippered section to hold the adapter tips and cable so that they are not smooshed against the battery itself.Overall, if you would like to have a backup battery to keep in your briefcase, purse, or whatever, to know that your devices will be useable at all times, the OXA Juice Box S1 is a great product. With the multiple adapter tips allowing it to charge devices from other manufacturers as well as the sleek, sturdy construction, this battery is definitely worth the money, especially with how long that it lasts between charges! With the nifty flashlight at the end to help you see the ports in a darker room, the Juice Box S1 is worth every penny.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

It is, however, not the best I've used.Having used a ton of &#34;power bank&#34; devices, I've got a few things I have come to expect from them:Easy chargingGood indication of power level on the battery2A and 1A charging portsThe OXA 7800 Juice Box has all three of these.Where a &#34;power bank&#34; begins to stand in a pack of its own is when they begin adding features or make design decisions for easy travel and so on.The OXA has a decently bright LED light for flashlight usage, which is a nice to have feature, but not needed. Another added bonus is the ability to charge more than one device at a time. Some of the older devices I've used offered 1A and 2A capability, but only allowed charging of one device at a time, which is a bit of a pain if you're traveling with more than one device and need remote charge capability. This device excels here, allowing dual charging of devices.Where it falls down for me is it's a bit heavier than expected at this capacity. The weight is also not evenly distributed, with the majority of the cells likely sitting in the bottom of the device. The size is also a little thick for what I expect of a device with this capacity, meaning it probably isn't easy to just slip into a pocket. If you carry a bag of some sort, no problem, but if you travel without a bag, keeping this in your pocket might prove a challenge.But that's the thing. It's only the size and weight that give me pause on recommending this one whole heartedly. So if you don't mind the odd weight distribution and can find utility in the flashlight, this is NOT a bad choice of power banks.

I don't think you can ever have too many :), and this one has a couple of features that make it a good choice to take along on trips or as a regular part of your backpack.I charged the unit out of the box, as it showed it was down to a single LED indicator (0 to 25%). It seemed to be a bit on the slow side when it came to recharging, as it was still flashing on the fourth LED after about eight hours. I'm not sure if that last percentage point or two was preventing it from showing solid lights, or whether I was just impatient. Regardless, I plugged in my iPhone 5S which was sitting at 42% and let it charge off the 2A plug. I was up to 85% 45 minutes later, so it definitely performed as expected in that regard. The unit was flashing on the third LED, so I had somewhere between 50% and 75% of the charge left.The Juice Box S1 comes with its own cord that has interchangeable tips for various devices. Given that there is no single overwhelming mobile device on the market, I appreciate this feature so that I can charge whatever I'm carrying around without having to manage separate cords at the same time. The Juice Box also comes with a 1A and 2A slot, so depending on your device mix, you could charge two devices at a time (albeit one would be a lot slower than the other). Add into the mix the nice touch of a flash light (activated by double-clicking the power button), and this is a handy device to carry around on a regular basis.Overall, I like the OXA Juice Box S1. I still prefer battery packs that have digital readouts so I know exactly how much power I have left, but that's overkill at times. For the everyday &#34;I want to have a backup charge for my phone&#34;, this is a very good choice.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This is a solid addition to my battery pack collection...", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}

This is almost identical in features asOXA Juice Box S2 10000mAh, except this power supply has 22% less power. They both have 2 amp and 1 amp USB ports, they both have the same cord and tip package, they both have a little white LED accessory light, and they are about the same dimensions. If I were going to choose between the two products, I'd buy the more powerful model for the few extra dollars. My wife disagrees with me, however, which is just par for the course. The only thing I can think of is that this model does have a slicker look to it.It has plenty of power to charge any cell phone or mp3 player, and would greatly extend the life of a tablet as well. With two ports, you can charge a smaller device like an iPod on the 1 amp port and charge a tablet or large smartphone using the 2 amp port. I did this with my Galaxy Note 2 and iPod Touch 4th Generation and the power supply took both devices from less than 10% to fully charged in just a couple hours. My only issue with this and many current power supplies is that you can't effectively charge two high energy devices like my Samsung GAlaxy Note 2 phone and my Asus T100 tablet. Both ship with 2 amp chargers and both need at least 1.5 amps to increase a charge. Anything less and you're basically just keeping the charge of the device at it's current level.All things considered, this is a good product, and at the $21.99 it's currently being offered for, it's competitive with other manufactures' products.

The only thing that is remotely problematic is having an extra cord available for charging, which most of us do. My favorite thing to do to test the capability of any battery pack, except for ones 2500mAh and below, is to try them out on my iPad. After a partial charge, I started my rather informal test. I don&#8217;t sit on the battery pack, but check and record how it is doing now and then.The EasyAcc was fully charged when I began and I expected a good performance and got it. This battery pack is a mid-range pack and if you want a faster charge for you phone or tablet, I&#8217;d recommend heading up to the 10000 - 13000mAh range. You cannot expect more from a battery pack than it is intended to do.What surprised me was how well and how rapid the charge was for a 5000mAh battery pack. I test a lot of battery packs and it performed well as expected. The slim, sleek look was very appealing.

The choice will ultimately come down to your needs. If you spend most of your time near a wall outlet, then your standard wall charger will be all that you will almost ever need. If you spend a lot of time traveling, especially via a plane, and you tend to carry a lot of gadgets with you, then I would recommend you look into getting at least a 10,000 mAh external battery. For everything in between you can select the battery size closest to your needs and the kind of gadgets you carry around. I would not recommend going below a 5,000 mAh battery though. The smaller batteries will probably not be sufficiently big for a full recharge if you don't remember to charge them up regularly.This is a very nice, effective, and compact battery. It is slightly thinner than iPhone 5/5S and just a bit wider. It can be easily carried around in a small messenger bag, briefcase, or a purse. It can even fit in a pocket (hey, it is the size of a phone), but I would personally not recommend it.The battery doesn't come with its own charging adapter or cable, which is not such a big deal for me: I have plenty of micro USB cables laying around. The battery has two charging ports and a permanently attached charging micro USB cable. This feature makes this battery particularly suitable for those who use that kind of charging input.

I also tried it with several other micro-USB charging devices (Galaxy S 3, Kindle, headphones, ...) and it worked fine with all of them, although I did not test them fully to ascertain the total charging time.Overall, I am very pleased with this battery and would recommend it to anyone who is in a need of small extra charging while on the go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Small, Convenient, Effective", "unixReviewTime": 1381708800, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2013"}

Requires a Micro USB cable to charge the power bank, which is not included.&#9830; Has a built-in flashlight.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a professional looking box with product information on all sides.  Inside the box was the power bank encased in a form fitting plastic insert to protect it and an instruction manual. It did not come with a Micro USB cable that is required to charge the power bank, so make sure you have one or you will need to purchase one.  This power bank is pretty interesting.  It has a really nice matte finish and is extremely thin.  It has four tiny blue LEDs on the top to indicate remaining capacity.  It also has a power button and a built-in flashlight as an added bonus.  It states that it is a Dual Port charger, but that actually means a 1.5A Normal USB port and a built in 1A Micro USB charging cable.  It has a maximum total output of 2.5A.  You can only use it as dual port if one of your devices uses a Micro USB cable.  Quite a variety of different features.  Overall, it looks very nice and seems to have a good quality build.&#9830; Use and Performance - It came with some charge to it so I plugged it into my computer and charged it until it was full. The four blue lights stopped blinking and stayed on indicating that the Power Bank was full. After it was full I did some testing.Test #1 (Charging Speed Test) - Since this is a larger capacity power bank, I decided to focus my testing on charging my iPad 2.  I took my iPad 2 that had 30% battery left and started charging it.  After 10 minutes, the charge increased to 32% and after 20 minutes, the charge increased to 35%.  An increase of about 2.5% per minute, which is pretty good for an iPad.  Overall, good results.Test #2 (Charging Capacity Test) - After 20 minutes, I continued to charge it to see how much juice this power bank had. I let it go and checked it several hours later to find that the power bank was empty and the charge increased to 80%, a 50% total increase.  This was very good.  On average, most power banks lose about 30% of their capacity during the charge process, so a 5000mAh battery usually gets about 3500mAh of effective charging capacity into devices. With a battery capacity on an iPad 2 of about 7000mAh, a 50% increase (or 3500mAh increase), is right in-line with the effective capacity of this power bank.  Pretty impressive for the extremely thin form factor.Conclusion:Overall, the EasyAcc 5000mAh 2.5A Dual Port Ultra-Slim Power Bank was very impressive during my initial tests and usage. The charging speed performance was as good as competing products. The product has a good effective capacity in an extremely thin package, making it easy to transport in a bag or briefcase. It looks very sleek and feels very solid. It has some interesting features, like the built in Micro USB charging cable, but the dual charging port feature will only be useful if you have a device that charges with a Micro USB cable.  Overall, it is a nice looking and nice performing power bank that is worth consideration.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2013"}

For my purposes this is an outstanding 'hedge' on a number of levels, but I want to get the caveats out of the way first.While this will work with an array of Apple and Android devices, including powered speakers, the instructions specifically exclude compatibility with Play Stations (PSP), the Blackberry, and Samsung tablets. If you have one of those this is NOT for you. Otherwise read on.This will work with most other 5 volt devices that require 1 or 2 amp power. There is an input on the bottom for attaching a micro USB connector for charging. I have successfully used my Samsung Galaxy Note II's charger and a generic one. I did not time my first charge out of the box, but am guessing that it took around four hours. Note that the instructions warn against using this to power a device while charging because it will shorten the service life of the battery pack.There is also a second port on the bottom of the battery pack for attaching an Apple USB cable to charge iPhones and other devices that require the 5 volt, 1 or 2 amp output with a standard USB end for the power source and whichever plug configuration works with the device's power in port. To be honest I use this port for my Galaxy Note II instead of the attached micro USB because I prefer a heavier cable. However, the built-in cable is a nice touch because in a true emergency the last thing you need to do is scramble around looking for a cable.I have tested this with my Galaxy Note II, which has extensive battery life (I can use it all day and still have some in reserve.) I also tested this with a friend's iPhone 4S. At 5000 milliamp hours (mAh) capacity this battery has about 40% more the capacity than my Samsung Galaxy Note II (3100 mAh). For the iPhone 4S it has over twice the capacity than the 1420 mAh battery in that phone. This provides a nice margin of back-up for those days when you are out and about and using your phone a lot. It's also perfect for emergency back-up while camping.There is a built-in flashlight that is relatively bright (especially in the dark). However it takes a little practice to turn it on and off: you need to press and hold the power button for a few seconds to cycle it on and off. I noticed that the battery heats up when you use the light so I personally would only use it in a dire emergency.Overall this is a handy - and very inexpensive - source of back-up power. I would not recommend routine using at to extend time for playing around because you will not only go through its reserve quickly, but will also probably reduce the service life. However, for a spare for important calls or sending a critical email on low battery or a true emergency this is cheap insurance. And it's small enough to fit in a tiny purse or pocket.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Inexpensive way to have emergency back-up, but read the caveats", "unixReviewTime": 1380326400, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2013"}

While the talk / music time is listed as 5 hours, that is probably a max amount of time. In reality, 3-5 hours is more accurate. Still, I use a lot more standby time than I do talk time, so I found it to be well within my acceptable limits.While I didn't use it significantly for phone calls, I did test it and was pleased with the sound on both ends of the call, both incoming and reception from the microphone picking up voice on the home phone I used.All in all, a very nice little headphone, easy to use with well-written instructions.

The headset has a swiveling center stem, which permits it to be worn on either ear.The headset comes with three silicone inserts of different sizes.  The inserts are designed to rest just outside the aural canal, rather than being inserted inside.  While not the most comfortable thing to have in your ear, wearing the FreeGo is not that bad, and you do kind of get used to it after a while.  Your results may vary, but I don't experience a great deal of irritation, even when worn for a long period of time.  Since the insert doesn't seal in the ear, you can still hear a lot of the ambient sound, so you may need to adjust the volume accordingly.A sample was provided for evaluation, and initially I wasn't that pleased with the location of the \"multifunction button\", which among other things, is used to connect to an incoming call.  The button is located in the center of the earpiece, right over the aural canal, and I have to feel around a bit to find it.  I have an aversion to pressing directly into my ear, and would like it better if the multifunction button was located on the section that rests on the top of the ear, say below where the volume controls are.Other than the multifunction button, I don't have any major issues with the FreeGo.  The earpiece is pretty light, and is well supported by the ear, without causing pain.  If some discomfort does occur, you can always try switching ears.

I have a problem getting ear buds to fit properly.  Sure, theBose QuietComfort 20ifits nicely but it's a tad more expensive than this set and not even Bluetooth.  (It can be and that's another story.)  Otherwise, I usually have to resort to custom made ear gels.  It has me feeling like a secret service agent or musician and can cost as much as the headsetThen, along came these.  They fit.  They're comfortable and secure.  They block outside noise.  They are, in general, very good.- There is no shading.  That's where carrying your phone in a particular pocket puts your body between it and the headset receiver and you start to lose signal.  Usually that's either my right or left pants pocket.  With these it's neither.  I get a clear signal regardless of how I carry my phone.After extensive experimentation I discovered I could shade the signal by sitting on my phone.  I rarely (rear-ly?) do that on purpose.  I suppose that could also translate into a way of carrying the phone which would also cause shading and I'm not going there.  Under normal circumstances you won't have to change the way you carry your phone to get a clear signal.Here's a few issues I have.- They don't have an on-screen battery level indicator.  I realize it's a protocol kind of thing and in this case not an issue because the battery life is... well almost forever.- The buttons are a bit difficult for me to operate with my clumsy, stubby fingers.  I think my parents and the manufacturer share fault for this issue.The headset comes with three sizes of silicon ear tips.  For me, medium sort of worked and I was surprised how much more secure things were when I switched to large.  There's also a handy suede-ish drawstring bag that went into my drawstring bag drawer and a micro USB charging cable that didn't go into my USB cable drawer because it's white and easier to spot at the bottom of my briefcase.In addition to using these during the day I've also found them great for listening at bedtime.  I like falling asleep to music and use earphones so I don't disturb everyone around me.  Cordless is better than corded because turning over won't draw my phone onto the floor.

They are not ugly, just rather plain looking plastic rectangles. Since there is no product photo at the time I'm posting this review, I uploaded a photo to give an idea of how they look.The second though I had was &#34;uncomfortable.&#34; That proved to be my fault - I put them on as I do my other bluetooth buds, with the cord at my neck. After struggling to get them to have some measure of comfort, I looked at the user guide and followed the instructions for wearing them (cord in the back; loop the cord over your ear; position the buds with the cord entry up). Smooth sailing after that, and they turned out to be one of the more comfortable and lightweight buds I've used.The build quality is not sterling, but more than adequate given the price. The on/off switch (called the multi-controller) has a positive click, which is good, but is positioned in such a way that you have to hit it with a fingernail to depress it. The cord is of decent quality, but could benefit from a couple extra inches of length for greater flexibility in use. The volume control &#34;bumps&#34; are a bit hard to find with your finger when wearing the buds.No problems pairing it with a Kindle Fire. The bluetooth range is quite good - about 20 feet with zero dropouts; about 25 feet with only a minor drop out or two.The sound quality is impressive with regard to bass - it puts out far more bass than I expected. A bit muddy, but still more than ample. It does fall a bit short on the mid and upper ranges. The muddiness continues and becomes more apparent. The result is adequate, but not impressive sound quality. It's better suited to bass-heavy music or movie dialog than light instrumentals or vocals. It does excel with regard to volume - you can crank these guys way up!Another area of excellence is sound isolation. The buds fit snugly (it comes with three sizes of tips for adjustment) and do a great job of cutting out external noise. That's important for me, since my primary use will be while exercising, and external noise is always irritating.It recharges using a supplied USB cable. The charge port seems well-anchored and has a rubber flap to keep out dirt and moisture. It also comes with a really nice carry pouch. Sort of a velvet-like material with a drawstring top closure.At the present price point (roughly $30) these are very impressive performers. No, they don't excel in every area, but they hit a performance level that makes them a great choice for &#34;rough&#34; use (e.g., workouts, kids, etc.). A good match for when you want enough performance to enjoy using them, but still keep the cost low so you won't cry if they get crushed underfoot while on the treadmill, or the kids lose them.4.5 stars rounded to 5 since I am quite impressed with the comfort and sound isolation.[Sample provided for review]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Some faults, but very impressive for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1379462400, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2013"}

The headphones have to stay in place whether I'm running, jumping, or lunging, and they have to provide good enough sound to block out distractions.  And I would like to be able to answer my iPhone if necessary.  These Brightech Active2 headphones mostly fit my criteria.Because the cable linking the two sides of the headphones is worn looped over the ears and worn behind the head, just putting them on can take some getting used to, especially since the angled in-ear pieces seem impossibly oriented.  But once on, they mostly stay put, and that's not only due to the angled earpieces but also to the lightweight build.  My biggest issue with these is keeping the cables looped over my ears.  They won't stay, maybe because I have small ears or because my hair knocks them loose.  This Brightech Bluetooth headset is not the only back-of-the-head set that I have difficulty keeping on; I'm beginning to think that manufacturers don't keep women's smaller ears and heads in mind when they design their products.The sound is pretty good.  I listened to one track that has a singer whispering in the left ear, and it's was clear as could be.  Vocals, bass, and treble are clear, although sound lacks dimension.  They don't have the kind of quality that makes you stop and listen, but then again, the price doesn't pretend that they can go there.  These sound plenty good enough for a workout or just listening to when I'm moving about the house and yard.Besides the loops that keep falling off my ears, the other thing I'm not wild about is the look.  The headphones look a little chunky, although I understand that they need to be big enough to contain the receiver/transmitter.  Bluetooth range is adequate when I use my iPhone, about 20 feet.  With my 3rd generation iPad, it is much better at 30 feet or so.  The build-quality is so-so.  I can't talk about longevity since I've had mine for only a few weeks, but the buttons and body feel cheap.  Of course, they have to be lightweight -- and that's a real plus with these; however, I wish they were more stylish and felt more solid.I like these, but I'm not in love with them.

They seem an almost ideal way of listening to music or making the phone calls. The Bluetooth headsets are ideal for workouts: compact, unobtrusive, and very functional. I have gone through at least five MOTOROKR S9 and MotoROKR S9-HD headsets, four different Jabra Bluetooth headsets, and several headsets from smaller manufacturers, all of which shared one common major shortcoming: they were not sweat-proof and inevitably stopped working after less than a year of use.In terms of functionality, my favorite Bluetooth headsets are the stereo sport variety kinds. They are extremely compact and ideally suited for what I primarily use headphones for these days: listening to music while working out. This Brightech Active2 headset falls in that category. It is a decent headset with a few attractive features, but it still has a fair share of shortcomings. Here are some of my impressions:Pros:- Lightweight and compact. These are the most lightweight bluetooth stereo headphones that I've ever come across. While they are in my ears I can hardly notice that they are there.- Great price. You'll be hard pressed to find a better deal on stereo Bluetooth headphones anywhere. Sure, you can try getting some of the cheap knockoffs on eBay (and I had gone down that route before), but chances are none of those will really work. Or will work for about a week before they completely break down.- Decent sound. I really don't have very high expectations from the exercise headphones when it comes to the quality of sound. I just need the beat to be fairly strong and the music not to be &#34;muddy.&#34; These headphones satisfy on both accounts.- Easy pairing. I've paired them with my iPhone without any issues.- Quick charging. It took me a couple of hours to get them fully charged.Cons:- Short cord. The cord that connects the two headphones and keeps them together is very short. It is adjustable, but even at its longest extension it is just barely long enough to have these headphones wrap around my head.- Very loose fit. I tried wrapping them around my ears as shown in instructions, but even still they keep coming out constantly while I am running. They are slightly better for the types of exercise that don't require a lot of fast motion.- Very small and inconspicuous buttons. Those are really hard to reach and press properly, especially while exercising.- Cheap build quality. They don't imbue me with the sense of confidence that they will last a while. I've used them for a couple of weeks, and so far they've done well, but from my prior experience I know that this doesn't mean much in the long run. *Every* pair of bluetooth exercise headphones that I've ever tested has failed in the end. All of the manufacturers try to make theirs sweat-proof, but so far I've not come across one that was actually able to pull it off. The good news about these headphones in particular is that they are pretty inexpensive, so if they manage to last for at least a half a year, they would still be worth it in my opinion.- No battery level indicator. Most bluetooth headsets tell me on my iPhone how much battery charge there is left. This one starts beeping a few minutes before it runs out of power, but other than that it gives you no advanced warning.This could be a really great headset if they addressed some of these issues that I've pointed out. Even so, for the price you will probably not get a better bluetooth stereo sport headset.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "3.5 Stars - They Work", "unixReviewTime": 1394064000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2014"}

I had to walk pretty far away from my phone before it lost connection.&#9830; Comfortable to wear once positioned properly and has a strong hold in your ears (don't easily fall out).&#9830; The cable is a little short for my big head.  Fits, but no slack left.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a professional looking hanging display box with product information on it. Inside the box was the headphones, an instruction manual, a Micro USB charging cable, some additional ear pieces and a carrying bag. The headphones look a bit big, but they are very light and don't feel big in your ears.  The Micro USB charging port has a rubber cover to protect it and a few rubber buttons around it.  The headphones are attached together by a wire with a sliding clip for sizing it.  I found that the cable fit me fine, but I made it as long as possible, so there was no slack left.  It could have been a tiny bit longer.  The headphones had a decent build quality, not bad for this price range.&#9830; Installation - The instruction manual was pretty long and informative.  I had no problem pairing the headphones with my Windows 7 PC and my iPhone 5.  Everything went perfectly and reconnecting was automatic. I plugged in the included USB charging cable into the headphones and into my computer to give it an initial charge before testing it out.  Once charged, it took a minute to figure out how they are supposed to sit in my ears.  There is an included picture where they are facing straight forward with the wire going upwards and then back around your head.  I found that they fit more tightly when I twisted them to where the headphones were angled forward and upwards slightly.  That position gave me a tight, comfortable seal.  Basically, you just twist them around until you are comfortable.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the headphones were charged and I had them on, a tested them with my Windows 7 PC and my iPhone 5.  Getting everything to work was very easy.  In Windows 7, I just switched my speaker setting to the headphones and they worked perfectly.  On my iPhone 5, I just used the output switching button to activate the headphones, again with no problem.  I played various videos on my PC and music and podcasts on my iPhone and found that the sound quality was pretty good.  I could hear a little heavier low end (bass) which overpowered the high end (treble) a bit.  The big benefit of the headphones is that you are now wireless.  You have complete freedom to move and the range was a very good 20-25 feet away from my iPhone.  Once in your ears properly, they are also very secure.  You can shake your head around quite a bit without worrying about them falling out.  This would be great for running or other exercise.Conclusion:Overall, this was a nice set of Bluetooth headphones.  It didn't have the best sound, but the sound was pretty good.  They give you great freedom of movement and the Bluetooth works really well.  They have a long lasting battery, and are easy to pair and use.  If you are looking for a nice set of Bluetooth headphones at a reasonable price, these are worth a look.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1379894400, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2013"}

Chambers", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "The Active2 headphones don't look like other Bluetooth headphones/earbuds that I've used, but they actually worked quite well, and the sound quality was excellent. I've used Bluetooth headphones that had a \"dongle\" hanging down below your chin - the dongle held the battery, electronics, mic, and controls. That type worked well, but the dongle flopped around if you were active, and sweat from your face could drip on it. The Active2 headphones have the battery, controls, mic, and Bluetooth circuitry in the left headphone, with the thin cable connecting the left and right earpieces going behind your head. In use, the headphones are very comfortable, and if the silicone earbuds don't fit your ears properly, the kit includes two extra sets of different sizes.The headphones paired easily with my Kindle Fire HD 7\" and Nexus 7 with the device name \"Active2 Headphones.\" No pin code or password was required. Having the volume controls on the left earpiece was a little bit awkward at first, but I got used to it after a while. I also paired the headphones with my Android phone, and they worked well for hands-free operation, although with the sound-suppressing of the firmly fitting earbuds, I can't recommend using them for phone calls, especially while driving.To my ear, the audio quality was excellent, with some of the best bass that I've heard from a pair of earbuds. The earbuds fit comfortably and were effective in keeping out all but the loudest ambient noise.The user guide mentions charging the headset's lithium polymer battery through the micro-USB port, but it doesn't say whether an AC charger can be used. I used a DC 5V~0.85A charger, which worked fine. The headset can also be recharged through a USB port of a PC. A charging cable is included. The talk time of six hours is comparable to other Bluetooth earphones that I've seen.THE VERDICT: The Active2 Bluetooth headphones are comfortable, easy to use headphones that provide excellent audio quality for streaming music, gaming, or phone calls. For people who run or do other vigorous activities while using the headphones, they're as sweat-proof as any other headsets that I've used.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable earphones with excellent audio", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2013"}

In fact, they sound just as good as a directly plugged line.  The pairing is easy.  Just hold down the power button for ten seconds until the light flashes blue and red.  This will work with just about any device that carries Bluetooth music or phone capabilities.  There are also small up/down buttons for volume.  The Bluetooth sginal will carry up to 30-feet.I turned my set on to full volume on both my phone and headset and the sound never distorted.  It was very loud however, so be careful when listening not to damage your ears.  The highs were very crisp and the mid-range perfect.  The bass was somewhere between slightly punchy and a tiny bit boomy, but I was able to get used to the sound until I found it just right.The microphone is also a tiny hole on the side and when a call comes in the sound is very good.  The music will fade out and fade back in when a call comes in or goes out.  The band is well made with a flat line that won't tangle and there is an adjustable clip that allows you to fit it to your head.I like the fact that the earpiece angles into your ear and are contoured to fit your ears, so they stay put.  They are very light, so it's easy to forget they are even on your head.  The square design is unique and I wish I could find some specifications on how the chamber, voice coil and magnet work.  They are very well made.  They even block sound very well.  They are not noise-cancelling except in a 'passive' sense, which is actually nicer than an 'active' noise cancellation.

Normally I am not the type to use ear buds, preferring regular headphones, but these were a revelation to me.What I most love is the rich sound. Honestly when I was testing these out I put on a Herbie Mann compilation and heard notes and nuances in this music that somehow escaped me when listening through my Bose speaker system. That alone makes these worth it to me.Set up was relatively easy, but understand up front that this will not pair with your device out of the box.

It shows up as Active2 as soon as you press the multi-function button and follow the scant (but clear) instructions.If I have any complaints they are about the button placement. Especially the multi-function button, which is nestled between the charger port and the wire connecting the second bud. On the plus side the charger port has a rubber strip that protects the connector when it's not in use.Since this is my first set of buds you need to factor in that despite my glowing endorsement I have nothing other than external speakers to which to compare the sound. The buds are comfortable in my ears and the sound - as I said - rivals my Bose so I am happy. Indeed, I am so happy that I am getting another pair of these as a gift for a friend who will be going in the hospital for some extensive surgery.

That's a very handy feature for people such as myself who like to quantify things - I feel better knowing that I have 43% power left rather than just seeing 2 light out of 4.  The display also counts up when the powerbank is being recharged, so you have a far more accurate determination of how much time it will take to charge up. Very nice feature.There are also some other pluses to this powerbank. It has a significant capacity (10000mAh) but packs it into a pretty compact size, with the powerbank measuring just short of 3 inches wide and about 4.25 inches tall. The weight is a bit hefty at 8.5 ounces.The on/off switch can easily be found, unlike other powerbanks that seem to try their best to hide the switch.

Very well done.It has an LED bulb to serve as a flashlight, and the bulb is located on the side rather than the top. The positioning makes it much easier to use as a flashlight.The overall build quality seems solid, with well-anchored ports and a nicely seamed plastic case.

On the minor miss side, the case is a huge fingerprint magnet. One of the worst I've seen in it's ability to get smudged and display those smudges. Also, the port labels are embossed into the plastic and are pretty much impossible to read even under good light.The worst issue relates to the best feature - the LCD screen. It's positioned very oddly. To read the digits properly, you have to look at it with the USB ports facing down. The screen is thus at the bottom of the case, making it hard to see. That's a really silly design flub, in my opinion.The case bottom (the end opposite that of the USB ports) is rounded, so the powerbank can't stand up unless you position it on its edges. While a rounded end looks nice, it's just not practical.The size is also a bit of a problem in that it's squat and wide, making it difficult to fit into laptop bag pouches, and making it feel uncomfortable in-hand. Skinnier and taller would have been a better direction to go in when it was designed.Given the price point, these design flubs are a let-down, and drop my rating to 3.5 stars.

The ends are rounded, so it feels good in my hand. There is a nice round power switch on one side. One press turns on the pack to charge devices; a second press turns on the nice bright flashlight. The pack is chunky, slightly longer and wider than an iPhone 4, and about two iPhones thick. The plastic is shiny and smooth, white doesn't show fingerprints.With a fully battery, I was able to charge my first generation iPad 100%. There are two USB outputs; one is a 2.1Amp output, designed for charging high current devices like an iPad. The iPad charged at the very high rate just like using the standard iPad A/C adapter. The second USB output is for lower current devices, like an iPhone. Two devices can be charged at once.There is a wonderful LCD display with the percentage battery charge left. I really like those percentage displays over the multiple dot or segment gauges.I have two minor complaints about the battery. The battery does not do pass-through charging. When the microUSB cable is plugged in to charge the battery, devices cannot be charged. The second problem is an odd little one - to me the LCD is mounted upside down. I hold the battery with the output ports on the top of the battery and then plug in my devices. The percent charge is upside down when held this way.The battery charges via microUSB. There is no AC adapter included in the box. To charge this battery, plug it into a computer USB port or the battery charger that came with the phone or tablet.I like this battery. It is a really good price. The capacity is just the right size, a full iPad charge or three full iPhone charges. I like the feel of the plastic.

Slightly bigger and thicker than a deck of cards.&#9830; Has two charging ports (a 2.1 Amp and a 1 Amp) for 3.1 Amp total output and simultaneous charging of two devices.&#9830; Good charging speeds as compared to competing power banks for both iPhones and iPads.&#9830; Good capacity. Added 80% charge (until full) to an iPad 2 and 44% charge to an iPhone 5 with a little charge left.&#9830; Small form factor that would be great for travel.&#9830; Has a built-in flashlight.&#9830; Shows a lot of fingerprints on the plastic case.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a professional looking box with product information on all sides. Inside the box was the power bank encased in a form fitting plastic insert to protect it.  It also came with a small, but informative instruction manual, a micro USB cable for charging the power bank, a multi-tip regular USB cable for charging devices and a carrying pouch.  It is a pretty small power bank that is slightly bigger and thicker than a deck of playing cards.  It has two USB ports (a 2.1A and a 1A) for charging devices, a micro USB input port for charging the power bank, a power button on one side and a built-in flashlight on the other side.  The position of the flashlight and power button makes holding and using it very comfortable.  The unique feature of this power bank is the built in LCD Display.  It shows the capacity remaining in the power bank in 1% increments.  Much more detailed than the typical four LEDs that most power banks have to show remaining capacity.  The LCD Display also shows which ports are in use by showing a 2.1A and/or a 1A symbol.  It also shows if the power bank is charging with an \"IN\" symbol or if devices are charging with an \"OUT\" symbol.  Quite a bit of information.  The power bank has a black, plastic case that shows a lot of fingerprints.  Not a big deal for me, but some people are bothered by this.  It has a plastic build, but feels very solid with tight seems and strong port connections.  Overall, it seems to have a quality build.&#9830; Use and Performance - It came with some charge to it so I plugged it into my computer and charged it until it was full. The LED Display showed 100% and the \"IN\" symbol stopped flashing indicating that the Power Bank was full. After it was full I did some testing.Test #1 (Charging Speed Test / Simultaneous) - Since this is a large capacity power bank, I decided to do a variety of tests to try out different charging situations. I took my iPad 2 that had 20% battery left and my iPhone 5 that had 58% battery left and started charging them in the 2.1A and 1.0A ports respectively.  After 10 minutes, the iPad charge increased to 23% and the iPhone charge increased to 65%.  Good speed on the iPad, but slightly slower than average on the iPhone.Test #2 (Charging Capacity Test) - After 10 minutes, I removed the iPhone and continued to charge the iPad to see how much juice this power bank had. I let it go and checked it the next morning.  I found that the iPad had a full charge and there was 19% capacity remaining in on the power bank's LCD Display.  With a battery capacity on an iPad 2 of about 7000mAh, an 80% increase is about a 5600mAh increase.  It was good to see that this power bank was able to fully charge an iPad 2 after already adding 10% to an iPhone 5 and having some capacity remaining.Test #3 (Charging Speed Test / Single) - Not being happy with the iPhone 5 charging speed test when doing a simultaneous charge with an iPad 2, I decided to test the iPhone by itself.  This is after my capacity test and not recharging the power bank.  I plugged my iPhone into the the power bank (switching between 1A and 2.1A ports) for 30 minutes and the charge increased by 28%.  A much better result and almost in-line with the 1% per minute charging average for most power banks on an iPhone 5.  Not the fastest, but not bad.Total Capacity Summary - The power bank added 80% charge to an iPad 2 (5600mAh) and 44% charge to an iPhone 5 (650mAh) and had 3% capacity remaining on the LCD Display (200mAh) for a total of 6450mAh capacity. On average, most power banks lose about 30% of their capacity during the charge process, so a 10000mAh battery usually gets about 7000mAh of effective charging capacity into devices.  The results of my testing were a little lower than average, but not too bad for unscientific testing.Conclusion:Overall, the Etronic Jupiter787 10000mAh 3.1A Dual Port Power Bank was pretty impressive during my initial tests and usage. The charging speed was comparable to competing products and the product has a good effective capacity, although slightly less than average.  While it performed pretty well, what I really liked was the LCD Display that did a great job of providing valuable information on remaining capacity and charging status.  I like the true capacity percentage much better than having to guess the remaining capacity based on a couple of LEDs.  The LCD Display is the differentiator here that I feel makes it a great product.  Overall, the power bank performs well and offers some great features that make it worth considering.

Anything less will have to going back to your computer or electrical outlet to keep recharging.  The small size is great for packing and in all the power banks I have seen with this much power, the Jupiter is the smallest.This power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least.  The power bank weighs a meager 8.5 ounces and measures only 4.2&#8221; X 2.8&#8221; X 0.8&#8221;.  It also comes with an emergency LED flashlight which is fairly powerful (Note: this uses power quickly) and a travel pouch that is water resistant.  It is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device as the kit also includes an Apple 30-pin adapter and two other DC adapters.  It includes two USB cords with one having a female 3.5mm input and the other a micro-USB output.This device also includes two ports for charging; simultaneously if wanted.  One is a 5V/2.1A for Android and Apple devices and the other is a 5V/1A charge for most other devices.  Factoid:  The battery is a lithium polymer core which is a low maintenance battery.  There is no memory and no scheduled cycling.  That means your battery will last longer than most. In addition, the self-discharge is less than half compared to nickel-cadmium.  Lithium-ion cells cause little harm when disposed.This battery pack is unique, in that, it displays the power in exact digital increments up to 99% (1% - 99%). That means no guessing from 20%, 40%, 80% or whatever. You know exactly how much power is left.  I prefer this much more than a power bank that has, let&#8217;s say, four LED lights that represent 25% each.  With this battery, you know exactly how much power you have and how fast you are using it up.I would suggest looking at all types of power banks/battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. Also, check the prices on all batteries and the power!

Plus, they don't press against my ears and are very soft.When I first tried them, the dishwasher was running in the background, and these minimized the sound. But when my daughter came out to talk to me, I could easily hear her (once I turned the sound down).I enjoy the controls on these, once you get used to where they are on the earphone, it is easy to feel them by touch and operate them. I am using these with my computer and iPad rather than my iPhone, so I am not answering the phone with them and can't speak to how well they work in that capacity as far as clarity. I trust another reviewer will be able to speak to that.While having a multi controller might seem difficult, actually it is quite easy to use - pushing it down to turn it on (or pair it),  pushing it down again to turn it off, one click to answer or hang up a call, two clicks to refuse one. The forward/back buttons on the headphones (for music) are separate, so you won't accidentally skip your song forward when trying to turn the volume up or down.A majority of my music is &#34;easy listening,&#34; &#34;country,&#34; and &#34;praise,&#34; music, all of which are in midrange and played very well. I have some hearing loss in one ear so I turned these around to be certain that the sound was great in both speakers, and it was.

They also work well with other Bluetooth enabled devices like iPhones, iPads,Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (7-Inch, White), as well as your PC.BUILD QUALITY: Grade 'B'The P402 BT's have a build quality that's on par with their price point.  What I mean by that is that they are good, but not great. For example the thin wires coming out of each earpiece and running into the headpiece are exposed and could easily be pulled out or cut. These headphones do come with a nice carrying pouch, and with care, this shouldn't be an issue but it's worth noting.These headphones have a headpiece (the part that runs over the top of your head) that doesn't have any padding on it.  I can compress one of them, and the other (they run parallel to one another and have about a 1/2\" gap) is a bit stiffer (probably contains the thin wire mentioned before).  I found that after a bit of wearing the top of my head hurt.  In all honesty, I notice this with 99% of the headphones I wear, thus I generally wear 'in-ear' to avoid this, so it may just be me?The earpieces are relatively comfortable; well cushioned and covered my entire ear.  I found them somewhat uncomfortable (tight), even after several adjustments, but they did have a nice bit of noise cancelling. It is important to note that the earpieces seem to tilt more one direction than another, meaning you will need to try the headphones facing different directions to get the best fit.  The back of each earpiece has the ARCTIC name etched into on silver colored metal.I could move the metal pieces that connect into each earpiece (four contact points - two on each earpiece).  It felt as if I could easily pull them out, but I didn't want to disengage the headband from the earpieces so I left it alone.SOUND: 'B+'I have a pair ofBose AE2w Bluetooth Headphones - Blackwhich cost 5x's the list price of this headset, and I get more volume out of these, which surprised me!  The sound quality overall isn't bad either, but I did have to work to find the right EQ settings on my iOS devices to not be disappointed.  At first, I was unimpressed.  \"Loudness\" wasn't cutting it, so I switched around and eventually came to find a warmer, depth of tone that made me happy.These P402BT's won't satisfy audiophiles, but if you're willing to tweak your device's settings a bit, you'll find a 'happy place' with these earphones when using them with your tablet or smartphone for general entertainment use.They also have an integrated microphone, which makes them a good choice for Skype.  Directions for VOIP protocol is outlined in the included User Manual.Diagrams in the User Manual are small and can be tough to read as they are in grayscale, but I think most users will get the gist, and have no problems pairing their devices with these headphones and appreciating the functionality.When paired with your iPhone or smartphone, if a call comes in the music or show you're listening to will mute and you'll hear a ring indicating an incoming call.  One touch answers the call and hangs it up, resuming what you were listening to before the call came in.You can play, pause, and stop music, as well as moving tracks forward and backwards.  Most iOS devices running iOS 6 or higher will have no issues using these functions.Overall, sound quality is good, but adjustments on individual devices within the 'settings' for music or sound, will probably be required.BATTERY LIFE and DIRECTIONS: 'B+'With up to 30 hours of playback time, these are some of the best Bluetooth headphones for one charge and you're set for a long flight, bus or train ride. Charging is easily accomplished with the included USB cable, and takes about 2-3 hours for a full charge. A red LED light will be turned on during charging, and go off when the battery is fully charged. A blue LED appears when the unit is turned on, and it alternates between red and blue when actively pairing with a device.Directions for operating these headphones are fairly clear, but I wish the screenshots of iOS devices were not so dark and/or washed out as they are very hard to read.PRICE VS FEATURES: 'A'You're getting a good bang for your buck when purchasing these headphones. Not only can they be used for general listening, but they can also be used for VOIP calls, Skype, screencasting, and to answer phone calls when listening to music on your iPhone or smartphone.Most will be pleased with their performance and fit, and for general use they should be a good buy. They pair easily, and remained connected to my iOS devices without interruption - no dropped signal.

Typically I listen to a lot of talk radio throughout the day (news) using the iHeart Radio app on my iPhone, and these have worked very well for that. Plus being light weight, they don't cause head fatigue like some of my heavier headsets do.They come with a micro-USB charging cable and a pouch for keeping everything in when you're not using them. There is a built in mic, so when you're paired using Bluetooth to your cell phone, you can wear these and continue talking on the phone, or even use them for VoIP calls. The buttons to control everything are on the outer sides of the ear cups, so everything is cordless, except for charging up the battery.

They excel with regard to comfort - the ear padding is plush and they have a nice balance between grip (e.g., staying put when you move) and comfort. The headband consists of 2 plastic rods without any padding, but doesn't cause a significant comfort issue.I had zero problems pairing these with a couple of different tablets (Android operating system and the Fire version of Android). Simple, quick and painless. The operating range is also excellent, with zero dropouts at about 20 feet and only minor dropouts at 25+ feet.The sound quality is quite good. While these open-ear designs don't have the booming bass quality of closed designs, I found the sound quality to be very good, especially in the midrange. They are an excellent choice for movie watching since the dialogue comes through so clearly.I like the operating controls, especially the volume switch. It's a rocker-type design, so it's very easy to use without having to look at the button - just find it by feel, and press up to increase volume and down to decrease. The multifunction button is in the middle of the rocker switch and is very easy to find by touch as well.The overall look is very snazzy, and the build quality appears solid.There is only a modest amount of sound isolation, but that again is an issue inherent with open-ear headphones. It does cut ambient sound reasonably well - I had no problems listening to music while on a noisy treadmill without the ambient sound interfering to any significant degree.Misses are the volume level. These have a rather limited upper volume range. Normally I set my tablet to about the 75% level and the headphone level to close to the upper point to get a good volume that blocks out ambient noise. With these, however, I had to set the tablet sound level to 100% and the earphone level also at 100%, and I still found them a bit lacking in volume. Given the price point, the range should be better.But other than the volume issue, no complaints. Good sound, good comfort, great range and easy-to-use controls.

While the P402BT headset looks the part, it wouldn't be a set I'd recommend for that type of environment.  As with other Arctic audio products I've tested, the P402BT doesn't have the volume of competing products in the same price range.  This did change depending on which apps I was using, with Audible seeming to be quieter than Pandora.  The sound quality is good, but not great.  There was a definite difference when enabling/disabling Beats Audio, but still not great sound.  I found the fit to be hit and miss; comfy but very loose.  Loose to the point where walking about the house doing chores would dislodge them from my head.  Arctic went with a mutl-function jog wheel type control for power and volume controls, and while it works, the switch itself feels flimsy.  Certainly not what I'd expect of a set of headphones that (currently) cost a couple Jacksons and a Hamilton.  The large LED light to let you know the unit is charging or is turned on is nicely large, the cover for the micro USB charging port not well secured to the housing.  Making calls was an ok experience, nothing worth noting other than it worked.  The included microfiber sack to carry the headsets around in was a disappointment, compared to the cases Arctic offers with some of its other audio products.

That said, I normally cannot listen to full volume iTunes music on any of my devices because it's too loud, but with these Arctic over-ear headphones, I can boost the volume to maximum without any listening discomfort. If I were (more) hard of hearing, these would frustrate me, but because I'm not and because I don't like to blast music, these headphones are great.They are lightweight enough to wear for hours, and the adjustable headpiece ensures that I get a fit that keeps them in place. The sound quality is not bass-heavy, although it picks up the lower ranges nicely, giving the sound a balanced quality that headphones built specifically for rock often lack. The one criticism I have of the sound quality is that it lacks the depth of more expensive sets and even the company's other Bluetooth headphones, the ARCTIC P311 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones. Despite this, the sound -- instrumental and vocal -- is clear. These are definitely more comfortable and more noise-isolating than the P311 -- as I write this, there's a vacuum running in the next room, and I can't hear it. This is a huge plus.The Bluetooth range is about 30 unobstructed feet or 24 with a wall between. Most people won't range that far from their devices while listening, although if you plan to, make sure you don't need to range farther than the preceding.The controls are a little difficult to locate while wearing them because they don't stick up enough to locate by touch. I can answer calls, thanks to the built-in microphone, and use the voice activation (Siri) feature of my iPhone.  They come with a storage pouch and the cable needed to charge them via USB port.Although I enjoy listening to music through these, I prefer (somewhat) the P311 unless I need to block out noise.

Inside the box were the headphones, an instruction manual, and Micro USB charging cable and nice carrying bag.  You immediately see that this is a nice looking set of headphones.  The ear cups are very soft and comfortable.  The left side ear cup has a USB charging port, a multi-function button with volume control, FF/RW buttons and a multi-color LED.  It looks like it is built very well.&#9830; Installation - I had no problem pairing the headphones to my computer on the first try after holding down the multi-function button to get them into pairing mode.  Everything went perfectly and reconnecting was automatic. I plugged in the included Micro USB charging cable into the headphones and into my computer to give it an initial charge before testing it out.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the headphones were charged, a did a variety of tests to try them out using my Windows 7 PC.Test #1 (Sound Quality Test) - I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to Michael Bubl&eacute; to Excision Bass Heavy Dubstep (the Destroid album), and everything sounded good.  The bass was loud and deep with no distortion.  It handled the variable Bass sounds of the Dubstep with no problems and handled the highs and vocals of the Pop music pretty well.  The headphones sounded pretty nice overall, but could have used a little brighter mids and highs.Test #2 (Sound Performance Test) - After I got past the basic sound quality, I tried out a few more technical tests. I put on the headphones and started playing a Dolby HD Surround Sound test video. They sounded really great with some exceptional stereo and surround effects. I also played a frequency test file that started at 20Hz and found that the headphones started producing sound around the 27Hz range, which is really low.  The sound continued with sound being audible all the way up to 17000Hz. Excellent range for a set of headphones.Test #3 (Use Test) - When wearing the headphones, the ear cups are very soft and comfortable.  They are easy to adjust and you can wear them for a long time without your ears hurting.  The multi-function button plays and pauses music and rocks back and forth to increase and decrease the volume.  There are also fast forward and rewind buttons.  The headphones also have some additional microphone and speakerphone features as an added bonus.Conclusion:Overall, I was pretty happy with the sound quality of these headphones.  They had a great frequency range and sounded good at all volumes, but could have used slightly brighter mids and highs.  They were very comfortable to wear and connected easily to my Bluetooth devices.  If you are looking for a nice set of comfortable headphones, the ARCTIC P402BT's are worth a look.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1387152000, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2013"}

I am not going to repeat the information in the product description, which provides all of the specs. I will answer any questions in comments if I missed something that you deem important. I want to disclose what I like and don't like about this headphone set.What I most love is how light and comfortable they are. Unlike over-the-ear phones I used in the past, these are light and unobtrusive - after a few minutes I forget I am wearing them. The adjustments are simple and easy to get a nice fit to your head.Sound quality is excellent, but to be frank, falls short of mySony MDR-NC40 Noise Cancelling Headphone (Black). On the other hand, I prefer this to the Sony because there are no wires (one of my pet peeves) and this is a true hand's free phones/mic combo. In fact, I already gave my Sony phones to a friend after I tried this one out.Paring with my Samsung Galaxy Note II was as easy as holding down the multi-function button until it flashed, then scanning for bluetooth devices on my Note II until P402BT popped up in the list. From there I paired and connected and was enjoying music.  Do note that you need to fully charge this set of phones before you use them for the first time. The process takes about two hours, and once charged they work as described in the instructions.What sets these apart from other phones is this has a built-in mic for hand's free operation. You can answer incoming calls by merely tapping the multi-function button and end them the same way. I tested this feature with a pre-arranged call and my friend had no problem hearing me clearly, and I heard her equally so. If your phone is set up for voice dialing you can press the multi-function button twice and it will invoke that feature on your phone via bluetooth.Bottom line: I have quickly grown to love these phones because although they are not noise-canceling, they allow me to listen to music in stereo while cutting out most of the ambient and background noise. The fact that this also serves as a hand's free phone speaker/mic is a plus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable and convenient", "unixReviewTime": 1383264000, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2013"}

Construction seems to be very good, and the included carry bag is a nice touch to help keep them clean and unscathed when on the go.We spent the day playing and testing the headphone's sound and functions, enjoying the experience, and all agreed that the black & brushed chrome design is very stylish and pleasing to the eye. Additionally, for over-ear style headphones these are reasonably sized and fairly light weight... so you do not feel like you are wearing a football helmet. Very nice, well thought out design.These headphones came with a USB power cord that we plugged in to our Samsung phone's wall adapter, and the headset's battery fully charged in about an hour. We listened to music through these headphones for several hours without any sign that the battery was beginning to wear down at all. Excellent!The combination of the perfect tension provided by the headband and the soft, padded ear cups made these ARCTIC P402BT Bluetooth Stereo Headphones extremely comfortable to wear for hours at a time. No heat build up, no discomfort. One of the most comfortable over-ear style headphones that I have ever tried on.Tested with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and our teenage son's HTC Droid DNA, this headset was very quick and easy to pair with our phones. We played a varied selection including Jack Johnson, Chili Peppers, Green Day, Jimmy Buffett and Creed, from sources including Amazon's MP3 Cloud, Pandora and our own audio files. The results were decent; the bass played true though the midrange and treble were initially somewhat flat.  These headphones did respond well to equalizer adjustments and, once we cranked the mid and upper range bars significantly up, their sound popped nicely without noticeable distortion.While enjoying the music, we tested the inbound and outbound call capabilities and were very impressed. The mechanics of the ARCTIC P402BT headphones worked perfectly with our phones to mute the music and enable hands-free answering, dialing and texting (outbound voice text). Call clarity of the integrated microphone was good, though the voice heard through the ear speakers sounded a bit distant (as did the voice heard by the caller over the cell phone - somewhat of a light buzz in the background). The headset's volume and multi-funtion adjustments are easy to find by touch and very simple & effective to use. I would classify the reception on both ends as middle of the road.The documentation notes that there is a two year limited manufacturer's warranty, so if an issue arises before that two year period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive these headphones gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.As with other ARCTIC items we have purchased, we found that the manual that came with this headset was very well written, easy to follow, and includes perfect examples for iOS and Android users to follow for setup and use. Even with their kinda small type, ARCTIC manuals are the best written manuals we have seen for gear like this. Totally appreciate not having to decipher broken English.If you are looking for headphones of this style and price, for use similar to what I have described above, then we recommend these to you.

If you do not apply enough pressure, it will be unresponsive on some devices, with some devices requiring more pressure than others. While you don't have to apply a whole lot of pressure, just a light touch of the stylus may not work, so keep this in mind. Also, keeping the stylus perpendicular to the plane of the device works better in many cases (though not usually necessary). If these are issues for you, then you may not like using a stylus.My review for this 2 pack of premium styluses/styli is as follows.If you don't like bright colorful styluses, then this is a nice set of darker colors and are generally of higher quality than less expensive styluses. The finish is better and so is the tip of the stylus. The fiber tip of this stylus provides a better feel (smoothness) than more rubber like tips on other styluses, in my opinion anyway.Using a stylus helps keep fingerprints off your device, which is a nice benefit.Overall 4 stars because they are not as responsive as a real finger, but it does work well enough with a moderate amount of pressure applied.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice styli, but some quirks", "unixReviewTime": 1394496000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2014"}

This set, theSty-HD 17 pcs Colorful 3 Styles multipack, and theBusiness Stylus Executive Pen.  Of the three, the multipack set is the most generic.  Made almost completely in plastic with some plating to look like metal, this type of stylus, perhaps the exact same stylus, can be bought from a wide selection of vendors at different prices.  In use, they work pretty ok, but not perfectly.  The glide is a little off, especially with matte screen protectors.  During testing, I noted that these tend to not work as well with Apple devices compared to Android models.  Pressing slightly harder on the Apple screens would get better functionality, but rapid movement across the screen didn't work consistently.  Overall, tolerable performance for the cheap price, hence the three stars which matches Amazon's \"It's OK\" meaning.  Compared to its brethren, they work as well as the Business stylus, but lack the pen.  Speaking of the Business model, though asking a premium price, its performance isn't any better than the one from the multipack as they share the same type of tip.  It looks more business like, true, but even the pen doesn't work great.  After cleaning the tip of the pen to clear off the seal to prevent ink leaking out while in shipping, I found the writing to be uneven and scratchy.  I could literally hear the ball in the tip scratching at the the paper.  To me, not worth the current price of nine bucks, and three stars for it.  That leaves this model with the hybrid fiber tip.  Of all three, these performed the best across the board.  Much better glide and screen response.  Still not perfect, as rapid movement would miss on occasion, but certainly a cut above the others.  Again, the Apple devices didn't these as much as Android devices did, and matte screen protectors deteriorated the performance slightly.  Comparing all three to the stylus that comes with my Tegra Note, the Tegra's stylus is the easy winner in all subjective and objective testing.  This is not a surprise really, as the stylus and screen of the Tegra Note were designed specifically to work together.

If you do not apply enough pressure, it will be unresponsive on some devices, with some devices requiring more pressure than others. While you don't have to apply a whole lot of pressure, just a light touch of the stylus may not work, so keep this in mind. Also, keeping the stylus perpendicular to the plane of the device works better in many cases (though not usually necessary). If these are issues for you, then you may not like using a stylus.Using a stylus helps keep fingerprints off your device, which is a nice benefit.My review for this executive pen stylus is as follows.I like the handiness of a single stylus and real writing pen. The real writing pen writes well (in black ink) and I'd say is more of a finer point than a medium point. The pen clip is real metal unlike others which is often chrome colored plastic.The overall quality of this executive pen is higher than most others and the heft of it gives it a nice feel.Some reviews complain of dented pens, but my pen arrived without any dents.Overall 4 stars because it's not as responsive as a real finger, but it works well enough with a moderate amount of pressure applied.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice stylus with a real writing pen, but some quirks", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014"}

Rather than being slick and glossy, the barrel has a slight &#34;gun metal&#34; feel to it which I found very pleasant to hold in my hands and less prone to being dropped. I personally prefer a fatter barrel, but I know there are many who like a slim one, and I think this will certainly appeal not only to women, but many men as well: the slim barrel and gold trim lend more of an &#34;executive&#34; look to it...to use the pen's own descriptive term.I very much liked the rubbery capacitive tip (capacitive refers to &#34;screen&#34; technology that can detect a &#34;touch&#34; without applying pressure). I love using these tips, and I used the Sty-HD a lot on my phone screen and Kindle. I found it to be quite agreeable to use. I found no unpleasant &#34;drag time&#34; issues with the tip and thought it seemed to be very responsive. I don't foresee any problems with its strength or durability, either.I am not that impressed with its pen, however. While part of my problem is not the pen's &#34;fault,&#34; really, as I prefer a rollerball or gel tip, I took issue with the fact that the pen tip felt &#34;draggy&#34; and dryish. I don't know what kind of a refill the Sty-HD has, as the refill has no information on its exterior, but I was not that impressed with its writing ability and would be more impressed with the pen if I could slip in a more impressive writing instrument.Somewhat related to this is another problem as I see it: the stylus tip is HIDDEN when the pen is open. To me, it would make more sense if the pen were to be usable as a writing implement AND a stylus if the stylus tip was on the end of the UPPER barrel rather than the lower one. If the stylus were on the very top part of the pen case -- the part that must be taken off to get at the pen -- then the stylus would remain usable when the pen was out. I suppose some might say that this arrangement might create leakage problems for the more forgetful of us who might forget to put the cap back on when they put the pen back in their pocket, but I believe the argument for making the pen completely usable when open trumps that.So, I found the Sty-HD to be a fine stylus, but an inferior pen. If you want a stylus with a sleek look, a great feel, and nice capacitive responsiveness, and are only passably interested in a pen, then this is your stylus.NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Stylus: thumbs up --- Pen, thumbs down", "unixReviewTime": 1400284800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2014"}

This one, theSty-HD 17 pcs Colorful 3 Styles multipack, and theSty-HD 2 Pack of Premium Precision Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip.  Of the three, the multipack set is the most generic.  Made almost completely in plastic with some plating to look like metal, this type of stylus, perhaps the exact same stylus, can be bought from a wide selection of vendors at different prices.  In use, they work pretty ok, but not perfectly.  The glide is a little off, especially with matte screen protectors.  During testing, I noted that these tend to not work as well with Apple devices compared to Android models.  Pressing slightly harder on the Apple screens would get better functionality, but rapid movement across the screen didn't work consistently.  Overall, tolerable performance for the cheap price, hence the three stars which matches Amazon's \"It's OK\" meaning.  Compared to its brethren, they work as well as the Business stylus, but lack the pen.  Speaking of the Business model, though asking a premium price, its performance isn't any better than the one from the multipack as they share the same type of tip.  It looks more business like, true, but even the pen doesn't work great.  After cleaning the tip of the pen to clear off the seal to prevent ink leaking out while in shipping, I found the writing to be uneven and scratchy.  I could literally hear the ball in the tip scratching at the the paper.  To me, not worth the current price of nine bucks, and three stars for it.  That leaves this model with the hybrid fiber tip.  Of all three, these performed the best across the board.  Much better glide and screen response.  Still not perfect, as rapid movement would miss on occasion, but certainly a cut above the others.  Again, the Apple devices didn't these as much as Android devices did, and matte screen protectors deteriorated the performance slightly.  Comparing all three to the stylus that comes with my Tegra Note, the Tegra's stylus is the easy winner in all subjective and objective testing.  This is not a surprise really, as the stylus and screen of the Tegra Note were designed specifically to work together.  In the end, if you're wanting a decent stylus, hybrid tip is the one I'd suggest buying from Sty-HD.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not much or a stylus or pen", "unixReviewTime": 1394928000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2014"}

Still, I found it had the ability to charge a Kindle or phone or other products with ease. And I loved the sleek style of it, minus the back side of the review copy I was given (more on this in my final paragraph).There have been a few comments about the irony behind 5 Star AMERICA's Battery Charger being made in CHINA, but I think the most interesting fact is that they are offering a 9999-day Warranty. What's that, something like 30 years? I suppose they didn't want to commit to a LIFETIME warranty, so all they could muster up was a day short of ten thousand... If I'm still here, it will be my pacemaker that it's aiding.According to 5 Star America they accomplish this in part due to a higher conversion apparatus within it that allows the battery to stay cooler while accomplishing a better-than-average transference of battery power from it to the device it's charging. Five Star America declares on this page that its batteries can go through OVER 500 full charge/discharge cycles over the life of the product.It's remarkably easy to use...while there are almost no markings on the device other than product info on the back, and it has no on/off switch, it doesn't really require much to figure it out. There are only ports: one for input and the other for output. Up to three indicator lights appear near the output port to indicate its remaining charging potential - which were yellow in the case of my orange device - and it blinks as well when it is in use. The supplied three-foot long cord is flat, which I liked since it made rolling it up so natural and compact when not in use (about the size of four stacked quarters).I think the 3100mAh Battery Extender is a remarkable device that is not only inexpensive ($13.99 on Amazon for all but the green device, delivered...if you have Prime), but powerful too: its 2.1A output accomplished a full recharge of my Android smartphone in under two hours, and still had more potential charge left. As I said earlier, it successfully recharged my Kindle (which, to be honest, was not anywhere near fully discharged). I do not have an iPad, and I have heard conflicting reports as to the 3100's success there - but I think it wisest to say that it is highly unlikely that this small device could make any more headway there than a small extension towards hours of use. But I don't think it's designed to, either.All in all, I think the Five Star America 3100mAh battery extender is a great small product for recharging cellphones and smaller devices, which is really all any sensible person would use it for. It's made to be shoved into a pocket or a purse (including its three-foot cord which rolls up into a size not much bigger than about four or five quarters) and should serve its owner well as a backup when emergency battery extension or recharges are warranted.About the only negative thing about it (besides the America/China disparity some reviewers harp upon) is that the writing on its back side sort of ruins the aesthetic cleanliness of the product and its minimalist nuance.

Though this product is sold by 5 Star America, and is logoed with \"Designed for America,\" don't think this was made or designed in the US.  Like those special commemorative coins one sees ads for on TV, it's a foreign made/designed product.  Looking at the 5 Star Amaerica website, there is a claim: \"We are an external battery manufacturer based in United States of America.\"  The product is manufactured in China.  The website is registered to Ching Yat Chan, who lives in Hong Kong (China), and all relevant contacts are located there as well.With that out of the way, how about the battery pack itself?  I've reviewed quite a few of these, and this one is pretty decent, especially for the price. While it doesn't pack a ton of backup power, it's enough to refill most devices at least once.  Thin is right, and pretty light weight.  It reminds me a lot of an older iPod Touch in size and feel.  I've even has a couple people ask when I moved over the Apple camp, having only taken a sidelong look at it.  The construction is pretty solid, though the glossy front picks up a lot of fingerprints and scratches.  Unlike most of the units I've had a chance to play with, this one has auto detection.  Plug something in, and the unit immediately starts charging.  No on/off buttons to fool with. The unit included a 3 LED indicator let you know how much of a charge it has left, which is somewhat poorly located along the bottom edge. With all that real estate on the top surface, why it was decided to put the indicator along the edge is beyond me.  I can't agree with the claim that this is the fastest charging external battery pack out there, as there are other models with the same output available.  That output is what determines the charge rate, as well as the cable on some occasions.  While in use, the battery pack doesn't get hot, nor does it do this when charging up.  Checking the output with an oscilloscope and current clamp, I'm unhappy to say that the unit does not output the advertised 2A.  ~650mA was all I could get out of it on any device.  As a secondary test, I measured the charge rate of devices connected to the 5 Star America product vs a 2A AC adapter and one of the aforementioned competing battery packs.  Except for the devices that pulled under 650mA while charging, all devices connected to the 5 Star America battery charged at a substantially lower rate.  So, the claim to be the fastest charging pack was false, as was the 2A output rating.In conclusion, I can't suggest anyone buy this product.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Feeling patriotic?", "unixReviewTime": 1387411200, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2013"}

It can't be beat putting it in my pocket while charging my phone - it mates perfectly with my iPhone 4s.There are 4 pale blue LED's that indicate charge level. They are slightly visible through the face and a bit brighter looking straight on toward the USB port. The box includes a very nice looking microUSB cable to charge the battery.I was able to charge my iPhone 4s from about 20% to full 100% with 2 lights left on. Meaning, I can get almost another half a charge on my iPhone. It does charge an iPad at full high speed (the battery does output 2 Amps). This isn't something you'll want to do regularly; it only boosts the iPad Air about 40%.The battery looks great from the front; it has a great form factor, and does a good job charging. All isn't so wonderful with this battery though. There is this massive logo on the back of the battery that cannot be removed (I guess you could cover it with a SkinIt cover for an iPhone 3). The whole thing is butt ugly - a great big stylized American flag circle, directions in big white type, and 10 white circle logos for cautions. All that would be kind of OK in a roundabout way. But wait, the thing is \"Designed for America\" but made in China. There is just something wrong with all this flag waving and making things in China. Sorry, the irony is just too great for me. I do understand that every lithium ion battery is made in China; there is no way around that fact. But don't wave the US flag in my face while you do that.There is another small problem, because there is no power switch or test switch on the battery, the only way to tell how much charge is on the battery is to plug it into a device or start charging it with a microUSB cable. Virtually every battery I've seen lately has a button to show the charge level. If I'm grabbing this battery for the day, I darn well want to be certain it is fully charged. Can't do that easily with this battery.In the end, if you don't mind the American flag waving and using a product made in China (every portable battery is made in China), and you don't mind the inconvenience of figuring out the charge level of the battery; this is an excellent battery for charging cell phones.

In fact, with its black shiny face and green plastic frame, I keep getting it confused with my iPhone. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to press a home button on it. Once I turn it over, however, I cringe. The back is covered with black type, lots of black warning icons, a garish 5 Star America logo, contact information for the company, and a plea to leave a 5-star review on Amazon. Now, perhaps because I received a sample for review I got extra type. But even if I removed that type, the back would still be ugly and would still detract from an otherwise gorgeous design. It's a good thing the battery itself deserves five stars, even without prompting from the company.So, yes, the battery is a five-star product because it is the thinnest, lightest, most portable battery I've tested. I can slip it into my handbag's cell phone pocket along with my iPhone 5. The lightweight factor comes from plastic construction instead of the metal that many manufacturers use. While some people might consider this a minus, I love that it doesn't add a lot of weight and bulk. The battery's face measures approximately 4.5\" x 2.5\", and the whole unit is only 5/16\" thick.The power pack holds 2+ charges for my iPhone 5, and it has a 5v/2.1A output.

No thicker than an iPhone 5 and slightly smaller.&#9830; Single 2.1A USB charging port.&#9830; Small capacity power bank (3100mAh) which is best for phones, as opposed to tablets.&#9830; Good iPhone 5 charging speeds as compared to competing power banks.&#9830; Thin form factor that would be great for travel or slipping into a pocket/briefcase/purse.&#9830; No power button, so you turn it on and off by plugging in or unplugging a USB cable.&#9830; One side has clean black finish while the other side has a considerable amount of company branding, information and even a review request, which hurts the sleek look a little bit.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a plain hanging display bag. Inside the bag was the power bank wrapped in bubble wrap along with a basic instruction manual and a flat style Micro USB charging cable.  It has a really nice black finish on one side and a considerable amount of company branding, information and even a review request on the other side.  All that info looks a little out of place and hurts the sleek look of the power bank in my opinion.  Other than that, the power bank is very thin and small with a decent capacity for a phone.  It has a 2.1A USB charging output port and a Micro USB charging input port.  It also has three blue LED's that indicate remaining charge.  It didn't have a power button, so you turn it on and off by plugging in or unplugging a USB cable.  Overall, it seems to have a nice quality build.&#9830; Use and Performance - It came with some charge to it so I plugged it into my computer and charged it until it was full. The three blue lights stopped blinking and stayed on indicating that the Power Bank was full.  After it was full I did some testing.  I took my iPhone 5 that had 61% charge remaining and plugged it into the charging port.  I checked to see the progress periodically and found that after 10 minutes, the charge increased to 71% and after 30 minutes, the charge increased to 90%.  An increase of about 1% per minute, which is a great result, and in-line with competing power banks.  I then plugged in my iPad 2, and the 2.1A port was able to charge it with no problem.Conclusion:Overall, the 5 Star America 3100mAh Power Bank worked very well during my initial tests and usage. The charging speed performance was as good as competing products and has a good capacity in an extremely thin package, making it easy to transport in a pocket, bag or briefcase. It will also charge an iPad, but the small capacity makes it more suited for phones.  It looks very sleek and feels very solid, but does have the problem of too much branding and information on the one side, hurting the overall appearance in my opinion.  If you are looking for a thin power bank and you don't have a problem with the branding issues, this power bank is a great choice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1387152000, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2013"}

It's different from other portable battery chargers in almost every way: At less than a third of an inch thick, it's as thin as any charger I've seen (also thinner than any smartphone I've seen), and there are no buttons or other external controls. The product details indicate that the weight of the charger is 1.1 ounces, but on my postal scales, it looks like the weight is just under 3 ounces. Even at that, it's as light as any charger I've seen.The charger includes a 40&#34; USB charging cable with a micro-USB plug on one end and a standard Type A plug on the other. The charger can be recharged from a USB port or from an AC wall charger or vehicle charger. I charged it up with a 5V~1.0A wall charger, then used it to top off the charge on my Samsung Android phone. There was enough capacity remaining to boost the charge on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet. With a full charge, the battery charger should have enough capacity to completely recharge any cellphone on the market today, or extend the usable time of any tablet at least a few hours. It's all automatic too; there are no buttons to fiddle with. When the charger is plugged into a mobile device, recharging begins immediately and shuts off when the mobile device has been recharged to 100% or when the charger is depleted, whichever occurs first.Heavy duty users of smartphones and tablets who are away from recharging sources for much of the day will likely need more recharging capacity than this charger has. For many users, however, 3100mAh will be sufficient for their needs, and the small size and weight of the charger will be welcomed. And I have to give kudos to the manufacturer for mentioning that battery chargers have energy losses that reduce the effective capacity by up to 30% of the advertised capacity.

First, the battery itself is a nice little 3100mAH battery that will fit easily in your pocket and give you a little extra &#34;boost&#34; for your portable electronic devices such as iPhones and iPads.  The case itself is a candy-shell plastic design, similar to the new iPhone 5C.  In fact, it kind of looks like a small phone.  The top is a gloss black and makes you think it is either a screen or intended for something else.  The only display is 3 green LED's near the USB connector that provide power status during charging or discharging.  There is 1 input port which is a micro-USB, and 1 regular USB output port.  That port provides enough current (2.1A) to even charge an iPad, but of course, 3100mAH won't be able to fully charge a totally drained iPad.  However, the 2.1A supply means it will charge things fast.  It is impressive for a small battery charger.The battery also comes with a 40&#34; micro-USB cable which is quite high quality.  I have gotten quite a few of these battery chargers to review, and often they come with really low quality cables.  This one is impressive, and the color matches the battery color you choose.  Overall it is a nice effect.My conclusion is that it is a solid battery for the price and definitely garners 4 stars.  Some competitive products now have charging cables built-in, multiple output ports, on/off switches, and even LED flashlights, all in similarly thin profiles.  But they also cost more.  For the incredibly small size and low cost, this is a fine option.As for the &#34;5 Star America&#34; bit, this &#34;America&#34; marketing is really over the top.

The user manual reads, &#34;Our mission is to Designed for America so that premium quality product at excellent price will be available for our customers.&#34;  The word &#34;America&#34; appears in the user manual 19 times and on the battery itself 7 times.  The user manual states, &#34;About 5 Star America: We are based in Cheyenne Wyoming right in the middle of the great United States of America.....American quality = American pride&#34;.

Similarly it should be enough to fully-charge most slim-line phones, but only enough to top-up larger devices like tablets.  I don't really have a way to measure charging speed / current, but for my 1A devices this pack seemed \"normally\" speedy, comparable to using a 1A USB wall-charger.There's no on-off switch or other controls, so it's straightforward to use. Like most small battery packs, this unit can't charge and discharge at once. So if the pack is charging itself, the attached load is not charging-- there are times when I'm on the go that I'd like to be able to top-off the battery pack while it charges a device, rather than waiting until I'm \"back\" to my base to fully charge everything.The distinctive colors are a nice touch (mine is orange), making these units harder to accidentally leave behind.  The included (removable) flat USB cable matches the battery's color-- which doesn't really matter, but is a nice aesthetic touch.  The cable is long enough for the battery to sit on the desk while I hold the handset (that's being charged) in my hand or to my head.  That's a much better design than the short captive cables that require both battery and handset be held in-hand.  The model I received has some text on the back, which apparently the production models do not.The unit looks like a miniature iphone.  The front of the battery pack is even a glossy imitation of a screen, which I had hoped would display the power usage, but is just a facade.  That glossy \"screen\" draws smudges just like a real screen, so I'd rather have had the front be colored like the rest of the unit.Like most such battery packs, this one is made in China.

This seems a little long; I would expect charging in about 3.5 hours on a 1 amp circuit (and so 1 star off for long charging time). In practice, if you charge the battery overnight, you don't care at all, but if you need a charge during the day, you might become a little impatient.There are three little lights on top of the battery pack. There is no documentation anywhere about these, but I figured out the lights tell you the state of charge of the battery, and they /don't/ mean full, 2/3, and 1/3 charge. I noticed the battery stayed on 3 lights for hours, then 2 lights for maybe 15 minutes, then 1 light for just about 2 minutes. So it seems like they mean &#34;OK-low-critically low.&#34; I didn't find this especially helpful, and I would have liked to have had a little content in the user manual that tells me these things.But overall this is more than a little handy. Being light and small it's easily transported. It comes with a charging cord which also works to connect to devices with a micro-D connector (most Android phones). However, you should take along both cords (phone and battery pack) so you can charge them simultaneously at night. (I recommend one of the many multi-position charging plugs).What are the use cases? I have always carried a 2nd battery for my phone, but not all phones have a removable battery, so this charger can be used in lieu of a 2nd battery. It's not an exact substitute, because you don't have instant action; you have to charge the phone for a little while. That's something you can do while in flight on an airplane, for instance (terrific on overnight flights from Hawai`i to the mainland).You can also use this as a running time extender for your phone or other device if you're picnicking or camping somewhere with no ready electricity.There are many battery packs on the market that have more capacity, of course. But they cost more and are heavier and much less convenient. For simple use cases this battery pack is a definite recommendation.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Light, convenient, adequate for the job", "unixReviewTime": 1386806400, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2013"}

Also as usual I give my candid opinions below despite that kindness.My first impression of this unit was that it was incredibly ugly and frankly rather offensive. The unit I received for review is an obnoxious yellow color with a logo and extensive writing printed directly on it asking for positive reviews online. It's also clearly marked as 'Made in China' which is rather perturbing given it's made by a company called '5 Star America'. I certainly have nothing against China but if you're going to wrap yourself in the flag then you're rather obligated to follow through with the patriotism indicated by your name.On the positive side the unit does seem to be relatively effective at its job and the USB cable included is a nice flat one which resists most of the issues USB cables have. The problem comes in when you compare this to the photos here on Amazon. Other reviews have indicated that these review versions are different from the ones you get if you actually make a purchase. The photos show a normal USB cable so I'm rather at a loss as to what to think. If I tried to buy this I just have no idea what I would end up getting.In summary, I'm not entirely sure what to think because I don't know what relationship the product I received has to the one pictured. If they really are completely different as indicated in some other posts then anything I say is somewhat moot. If the unit is as featured in the photos then that's got pluses and minuses. All that having been said, I'd be really cautious spending money with this company. They seek reviews using one product and hope to apply it to an apparently different product.

This is not something I would buy on my own. Here's why.1. This isn't much more powerful than a &#34;lipstick&#34; charger, which is much more compact than this unit.[Update Dec. 7, 2013. Although this is rated as having an output of 2.1A, another review points out that in fact this charges at only 1A. I confirmed this because this unit will NOT charge my iPad. So the 2.1A output listing is deceptive and meaningless].3. I agree with other reviews that the design on the back is not only ugly but deceptive. There is a flag logo that says &#34;Designed for America&#34; yet the product is Made in China. The name of the company and this logo try to create the misleading impression that somehow the manufacture or design of this product is connected to America, which it is not. I find that personally offensive.A second deception is the picture on Amazon, which shows an orange back with a logo and some technical symbols only. But the unit I received had a white back that contained a &#34;billboard&#34; with all kinds of writing, including a solicitation for a review. I don't carry around &#34;billboards&#34; for companies.[The seller sent me an email that the &#34;billboard&#34; version I received was a &#34;review version&#34; but that what is pictured on Amazon is what purchasers receive. But I can review only what I am sent.]4. If you want a very sleek and attractive, not to mention more powerful and versatile, charger for your iPhone that is not much larger than this product, try the EasyAcc 5000mAh 2.5A Dual Port Fast Charging Ultra-Slim Portable External Battery Charger Pack PowerBank. It works great.5. If you want a compact charger that will charge an iPad, try the Gadgets 8400mAh External Portable Battery Pack Charger , which is amazingly compact for such a powerful charger.Note: When I tried to reply to the email that the seller sent me, I found out no responses could be sent to that email address. That always makes me suspicious. I would avoid this seller. And if you believe the &#34;9999 Days Warranty&#34;, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn that you might like to buy.Update December 10, 2013: I lowered my rating from three stars to two stars after reading another review that extensively tested this unit and confirmed that not only is the 2.1A output false, but so is the overall claim for how this unit charges. I also note that one or more persons is negging the critical reviews on this product. Please read those critical reviews carefully before you decide to order a product that simply doesn't live up to its promises.Update December 12, 2013: I recently received the ARCTIC Power Bank 4000 Ultra-Slim 2.0A Output 4000mAh Backup Battery/Charger for Tablet and Phone - Black.

I put it through some paces on my iPhone 4, and here's what I experienced with it...Power-wise (3100 mAh), I was able to get the equivalent of one full recharge (with a small bit left over) on my iPhone. In 70 minutes of charging, I went from 22% to 91%, which is right around the minute-per-percent that I usually look for. I then used it again to go from 60% to 93% in 40 minutes later on. The power bar lights went from three (fully charged) down to one. My guess is that there wasn't much juice left in it.In terms of design, it's very light and different than most chargers. It's made to look like a very thin smart phone, and you could be forgiven for thinking it was one on first glance. The front (on mine) is a black glossy surface (again, like a smart phone that's turned off), but it doesn't have any touch functions on it other than to collect fingerprints. The normal USB slot is on the bottom edge, with the microUSB slot on the side at the bottom. The provided microUSB cord is a flat cord which looks and feels very sturdy. The main use would be to charge the battery with the microUSB plug. There are no other cords or plug adapters provided, so you have to make sure you have your own in those cases (like for a lightning connector). I didn't try it out on my iPad (to test out the 2.1A output), but I did plug it in to make sure it was compatible without any errors. My feeling would be that it wouldn't due a good job of recharging the iPad, but it would slow down the drain if plugged in during use.Probably the main negative of this unit is the text in the skimpy documentation and on the back of the unit. The backside of the battery is covered with logos and text pointing you to Amazon to write a review. I've seen some people say that the company says the review units are different than &#34;retail&#34; units in terms of what's on the back, but either way it's a bit much. I'm also not thrilled with the emphasis on America in the company name, ad copy, etc... while it's actually manufactured in China. &#34;Designed For America&#34; does not mean &#34;Made In America&#34;.Bottom line... this is a decent external battery pack for &#34;just in case&#34; use. I'll make sure to keep it charged up and in my charger collection in the event of a prolonged power outage.

In fact, I tried putting the iPod case on the charger and it actually fit, albeit with a little stretching on one edge of the case. The charger came with a flat USB cable that is 40&#8221; long, &#8221; wide and 1/16&#8221; thick and in a color that matches the charger housing. The back of the sample I received is covered with a variety of information, part of which asks for a five star review. I see from Stephen M. Charme&#8217;s review that the seller informed him that the tacky text is only placed on sample units, but I agree with Stephen that I can only review what I&#8217;m given. Additionally, I find the &#8220;Designed for America&#8221; and American flag logo to be (intentionally I assume) misleading, since the units are made in China. This is the kind of marketing tricks that I find distasteful.With the above things being said, the charger does do an okay job of charging, but it definitely doesn't put out 5 volts at 2 amps. I know this not because I have an ammeter, but because the charger cannot keep up with my Galaxy Note 2 phone while playing one of my favorite games, even with volume muted and the screen brightness turned almost all the way down. Tonight I plugged the charger into my phone and played my game for about an hour. The phone&#8217;s battery was at 17% when I started playing and in spite of showing that it was charging, the battery level dropped to 8% by the end of the hour. The Note 2&#8217;s giant screen and fast processor make it difficult to charge when it&#8217;s under heavy load, but the 2 amp wall charger that came with the phone is able to slowly charge the phone under the conditions I used to test the 5 Star America charger.The 5 Star America charger had much more success when paired with my iPod Touch 4th Generation. I plugged the iPod into the charger with the iPod battery at about 10% and played music for five continuous hours while driving. At the end of my drive, the iPod&#8217;s battery was completely charged and the charger was displaying two of its three battery indicator lights.The charger itself can be charged using the included cable or any standard Micro USB B cable and any USB wall (AC) or car (DC) charger. I used a 3 amp wall charger and a 2.5 amp car charger and saw charging times between three and four hours to charge the depleted charger.When I rate an item, I take into account the performance the product offers for the price charged for the item. The charger is currently being offered at $13.99, which is competitive with other similar products being sold on Amazon. The 5 Star America charger does not, however, live up to the claims of the seller. Had I paid $14 for this device, I wouldn&#8217;t think I got a deal, but I wouldn't feel like I got ripped off either. In my opinion, it&#8217;s an okay buy for someone looking for an inexpensive, 3100mAh charger, but there may be better buys to be had.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not Great, but not Horrible Either", "unixReviewTime": 1388361600, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2013"}

For the price, I'm not sure you can do better than this one, and I've tried quite a few in recent months.PAIRING: \"Super easy!\"This nicely packaged speaker quickly paired with the following devices: Windows 7 PC, iPhone 4S, iPad 3, and Kindle Fire.To pair devices you turn the speaker on, and then hold the center button down for 8 seconds and wait for both red and blue lights to flash, which means the speaker actively searching for a device to pair with it. Make sure the device you want to pair with the speaker has Bluetooth enabled and is in pairing mode too.  The connection is made quickly, and remains solid - no cutting in and out - which has been an issue for me with other Bluetooth devices including my Bose Bluetooth headset.  I suspect this is due to the new Bluetooth 4.0 standard being used in this device, which extends the speaker's range to up to 33 feet.DIRECTIONS: \"Diagrams could be better.\"The User Manual directions for this speaker are on one sheet of paper.  When I first saw this, I thought that there was no way that would be adequate, but it's pretty well done and covers it all in step-by-step form.The only thing I wish was better was the pictures in 'Getting Connected' - 'For iOS' and 'For Android'.  They are small, dark and tough to read.  I think if the directions had been on a larger sheet of paper, or in a booklet form in color versus grayscale, the User Manual would be 5-stars.A diagram of the speaker is easy to read in the User Manual and it's also pictured on the sturdy, attractive blue and white box the speaker came packaged in.In the User Manual you'll find the following:- Package Contents (speaker, 3.5 line, Micro USB to USB cable, Manual and carrying case).- Function Diagram (of speaker and buttons)- Getting Connected (for Bluetooth and NFC One Touch pairing)- Music Operations- Phone Operations- LED Light SignalsNOTE: 2 Year Limited Warranty via ARCTIC - nice perk!FEATURES: \"Solid specs that equal performance.\"+ Up to 700 hours of Standby on 1 charge.+ Rechargeable battery via Micro USB (cord included).+ Accessories included; quality, gray nylon carrying bag, 3.5mm cord and Micro USB cord for charging.+ Omnidirectional Microphone for speakerphone mode.+ Full range driver with Bass radiator - it sounds rich and deep!+ Bluetooth 4.0; latest standard offers extended range and stability.

A very slight distortion was noted at the highest volume setting, but barely noticeable.CONCLUSION: \"You won't be disappointed in this speaker.\"Without reservation, I recommend this speaker. It's priced right, works perfectly for listening to music and movies, as well as acting as a speakerphone.  It's easy to use and the Bluetooth 4.0 connection has no dropped connections between paired devices.

The benefit of a small bluetooth speaker is the ability to carry it with you and, while some do come with a case, they are usually a thin nylon sack that offers zero protection. This case, however, is really well made. It has padding on the sides that provides protection in transit, a well-made zipper that you don't have to struggle with, and has two mesh pockets on the inside to keep cables stowed.I know it may sound a bit silly to go on about the case to that degree, but often it's the little things like that often make a product so much nicer to use.The speaker case is another strong plus for me. It is a soft, rubbery material that is highly slip resistant. Plus, it looks great, totally hides fingerprints, and feels nice as well. The attractive design extends to the grills, which are metal and look and feel nice as well.The control buttons on the front face for volume are small, but clearly marked. They have a solid click when depressed. The power and connection ports are on the edge and are recessed into the soft cover so that they don't interfere with positioning the speaker on-end should you want to.The sound quality is pretty good. The speaker has the same limitations of any other small speaker in that the bass is, at best, somewhat adequate, and the midrange is on the muddy side. But sound quality is always relative. This sounds 1,000 times better than the internal speaker of any tablet I've ever used, but it won't compare with the sound quality of a high end powered speaker. Given the price point, I consider the sound quality to be more than acceptable.Zero problems with operation - paired easily with a variety of bluetooth devices. It also can be used as a direct-connect speaker using a 3.5mm cable (included). This is where there's a quirk in the design. For some reason the volume controls are reversed when using it in direct connect mode - the minus button makes it louder and the middle button makes it softer. I didn't realize that was the way it was supposed to work until I read it in the instruction pamphlet (which is another high point - the manual is actually well written and helpful!). Strange quirk, but not something that detracts from usage.This is one of the better small speakers I've used, and while it is a bit more expensive than others, the better build quality, nicer design, and extras such as an excellent case make it a better value than most.

The Arctic model is similar in specification to most others on the market, but with an admittedly higher price tag.  Pairing up with each of my test devices was a cinch, both manually and with NFC (on the devices that support it).  The controls worked fine, but I think Arctic missed two steps here.  With other speakers I have, such as theSatechi BT Touch, the volume controls on the speaker toggle on the device they are connected to, rather than being individual. For example, turning the volume down on the speaker turns the volume down on the device.  The way it is now, the Arctic speaker and whatever device is driving it both have individual volume adjustments.  Secondly, no track control on the speaker itself.  The sound output is good, better than than the el-cheapo models I've come in contact with.  But, there isn't as much bass or total volume as there are in the better models.  The lack of volume seems to be a theme across the Arctic line, as I noted the same in their other products.  The battery life is great!

The finish on the unit is something I liked, a matte rubbery finish, very subdued in appearance.  Arctic tries to do some value adding to justify the premium price by including a zipper pouch to keep your speaker in and decent quality cables.  It's a good speaker, that's for sure, but, myself, I'm thinking the current price ($50) is too high compared to the competition.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Doing it right", "unixReviewTime": 1393113600, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2014"}

The box measures a mere 6\" x 1 3/4\" x 2.5\" and still manages to deliver a nicely balanced sound.

And it comes with a gray nylon, zippered case for storage.This small box is perfect for bookshelves, small spaces, and for portability. Note: I received a sample for review.UPDATE: I originally rated this three stars because my iPhone 5 dropped out a mere 8 feet away; however, with my iPad, I get good range, about 24 feet including going through walls and/or staircase.

Inside the box was the Speaker, an instruction manual, an Aux Cable, a Micro USB charging cable and a nice zippered case with mesh pockets on the inside for cables.  It looks really solid and nice and has a rubberized outside with an anti-skid feel to it.  It has a multifunction button, two volume buttons, a Micro USB charging port, an Aux port and an on/off switch.  It looks like it is designed and built well.&#9830; Installation - I plugged in the included Mini USB charging cable into the unit and into my computer to give it an initial charge before testing it out.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the speaker was charged, a did a variety of tests to try it out using my iPhone 5.Test #1 (Sound Quality Test) - I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to some Pop Music to Excision Bass Heavy Dubstep (the Destroid album), and the speaker handled everything I threw at it with no distortion and some pretty high volumes. It sounded very clear and nice.  It had pretty good bass sounds for a small speaker, but not booming bass (this is not a negative because no tiny speaker can produce booming bass). I really liked the sound overall.Test #2 (Sound Performance Test) - After I got past the basic sound quality, I tried out a few more technical tests. I put speaker directly in front of me and started playing a Dolby HD Surround Sound test video. It sounded really great, but produced minimal stereo or surround sound effects due to the close orientation of the speakers to each other. This isn't really a surprise, so no big deal.  I also played a frequency test file that started at 20Hz and found that the speaker started producing sound around the 33Hz range. The sound continued with sound being audible all the way up to 15000Hz. Good range for a small speaker.Test #3 (Use Test) - I tested the Bluetooth range by walking through my house and the speaker had a range of about 15-20 feet and was best with a straight line of sight to my device.  It didn't handle going through walls very well.  Not the best range, but not bad.  Once the sound testing was done via Bluetooth streaming, I tried out the sound from the Aux input cable from my iPhone and it sounded just as good. The speaker also has some additional speakerphone features as an added bonus.Conclusion:Overall, I like this speaker a lot.  It sounds really good and feels really solid.  It could use a little better Bluetooth range, but the sound quality makes up for that in my opinion.  If you are in the market for a small Bluetooth speaker, the ARCTIC S113BT is worth a look.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1387497600, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2013"}

The first thing that distinguishes this speaker from a pile of others that I have tested is this has a microphone for true hand's free operation.Since there are complete specs in the product description I will not repeat them here. Instead I'll highlight my experience and what I particularly like about this speaker. Out of the box I recommend charging it before tying to use it. Mine was shipped partially charged and it took about two hours to fully charge it.Pairing with bluetooth was simple: I turned the speaker on with a switch on the side, then pressed the multi-function button for about eight seconds until I got an alternating orange and blue light. I scanned for bluetooth devices on my Samsung Galaxy Note II and S113BT popped up. I selected that and was playing music as soon as it paired and connected.I tried the near field communication (NFC) pairing, but had to remove my Galaxy Note II from the case I use to accomplish that. Then the pairing popped up my S-voice application, so I abandoned that feature. I'll chalk that up to my phone's fault and my own inexperience with NFC.Sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small speaker. I always test speakers with Miles Davis' Kind of Blue because of the range of instruments exercise the full spectrum of sound. The bass response of this speaker is excellent, as is the mid and higher frequencies.Receiving phone calls is as simple as touching the multi-function button to receive an incoming call, which I pre-arranged for this evaluation. The person on the other end had no trouble hearing me clearly through the integrated mic, and I had no trouble clearly hearing her over the speakers.Overall this is a wonderful speaker that comes complete with a zippered case that actually protects it (it's waterproof), a charging cable and a 3.5mm cable to connect to headphone jacks if you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device.

This would be nice for traveling or just a place to store it when it isn't being used. But this speaker is used a lot! The sound is quite impressive with 2x3W RMS, 1x1.5&#34; full range drivers + 2x1.5&#34; bass radiators. 6W amplifier, and 4 diaphragms. I have a few favorite sound tracks that I used to test the sound. They are: Symphony No.3 in C minor, Op.78 &#34;Organ Symphony&#34; - 2b. Maestoso - Pi&ugrave; allegro - Molto allegro, Washington Bridge (Album Version), I Don't Want To Miss A Thing and also some Halloween sound effects recordings that have good speaker phasing. All of these sounded amazing considering the size of this speaker (6.75 inches, 3.25 inches, 2.5 inches). The sound is CD quality. In addition it features Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) for remote control functions such as forward/backward tracking skipping. The controls are on the front of the unit. I usually control it right from my phone or Kindle.Pairing was simple and quick with a couple iPhones, iTouch, and Kindle HD. It was easy to switch from one source to another and as soon as my husband heard some of the music he had stored on his phone, I haven't been able to get it away from him to pair with my phone. It has NFC pairing but we don't have any NFC devices to pair it with so I wasn't able to test that feature. When you get a phone call while playing music, the music pauses and the device doubles as a hands free speaker with its integrated omni-directional microphone. It's compact size makes it easy to bring along in the car and I've used it in the car for this purpose. It's also nice for outdoors. We bring it out when we're eating on the patio. It would be equally as nice for camping or at the beach because it gets about 8 hours of playtime on a single charge. And it's rubberized casing is nice because it doesn't scratch and it keeps it from slipping on hard surfaces like the kitchen countertop.This would make a nice gift because of the nice quality and presentation and also because it's easy to set up and use.I received a sample of this product for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound and high quality", "unixReviewTime": 1383696000, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2013"}

Very cool - well worth purchasing. The unit comes in multiple colors and the one we received is black. It came with a USB power cord that we plugged in to our Samsung phone's wall adapter, and the speaker fully charged in less than one hour.The excellent instructions made it easy to pair with our phones, and pairing was quick and trouble-free.  The phone paired with the speaker was always within three to 12 feet of the speaker, typically about eight feet away, with relatively good line of sight between the two devices.Tested with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and our teenage son's HTC Droid DNA, the first thing that we noticed was how well this speaker responded to the equalizers on those phones. At first the sound seemed flat, but then we began adjusting mixer settings and the speaker jumped to life. Additionally we found that when placed with the rear speaker set down on the counter or table (so that the volume controls face straight up), the impact on bass volume and resonance was outstanding - that position turns the counter-top (table, floor, any solid surface...) into a subwoofer reflector.Through the combination of the speaker's volume button, the phone's output volume setting, and equalizer's settings - we got this speaker to produce all the volume we would need from it. Bob Marley was Jammin' in the kitchen, and I could hear him from the third floor.We played an eclectic selection including Chili Peppers, Green Day, Bob Marley and Everlast, and even a little Eric Clapton, from sources including Amazon's MP3 Cloud, Pandora and our own audio files. The results were outstanding; with a little tweaking from the equalizers for the different mixes of music, we coaxed the ARCTIC S113BT speakers into producing very nice sound for several hours. If I didn't have to concentrate to write this review, I would still be listening to the great tunes right this moment.While enjoying the music, we tested the inbound and outbound call capabilities and were beyond impressed, having never made calls through this type of speaker system before. The mechanics of the ARCTIC S113BT worked seamlessly with our phones to mute the music and enable answering, hands-free calling and texting (voice text).  I took a walk down the lane to our house and then placed a call to my son's phone. He answered the call through the speaker -- we had a couple friends over and they chuckled at hearing me loud & clear over the speaker, and I had no problem at all listening to them all respond back through the speaker. Perfect tool to use as an impromptu speakerphone!By the way - how many times have you purchased electronics and found that the user manual is just worthless? NOT the case here; the manual that comes with this speaker is very well written, easy to follow, and includes perfect examples for iOS and Android users to follow for setup and use. Best manual we have seen for gear like this, and that is completely appreciated.The speaker's carton notes that there is a two year manufacturer's warranty, so if an issue arises before that two year period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this speaker gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you go back to the speaker's main sales page, I uploaded pictures showing details of the unit, the information on the carton, and the excellent manual. These pictures may be found on that main page by scrolling down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section.If you are looking for a speaker of this style and size with all of the extra hands-free call functionality, for use similar to what I have described above, then we totally recommend these to you.Go for it and enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "ARCTIC S113BT NFC/Bluetooth Stereo Speaker - Built-in Microphone - Hands-Free Calls - Black - Excellent Multi-function Speaker", "unixReviewTime": 1392681600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2014"}

I use it with my iPhone, and so far it has performed as promised.=== The Good Stuff ===* The unit is a reasonable size. It is roughly the size of two decks of cards placed end-to-end, and about twice as thick. It will fit comfortably in a coat pocket, but is a bit of a stretch for pants or shirt pockets. It seems fairly rugged, although I doubt it would stand up to moisture. It is relatively lightweight.* The sound quality is surprisingly good. Of course it pails next to the $3000 speakers in my media room, but that is not its purpose in life.  For something that is completely portable, it can put out enough sound so you can hear it over typical room noise. It will fill a small room with speaking level sound before it begins to distort. The bass is &#34;reasonable&#34;, but it is not going to shake your walls. I didn't notice any noise or crackle during bluetooth operation, and the pairing stayed intact for at least 20 feet. Bluetooth pairing and discovery has worked flawlessly. There is also an AUX input, allowing you to use a standard wired connector instead of bluetooth.* The unit charges pretty quickly- roughly 2-3 hours from a wall pack USB charger. (It uses a standard USB/Mini power cable). The speaker can play roughly 8 hours at a pretty moderate volume. The front controls (FF, REW, PLAY/PAUSE, VOLUME) worked as expected, although it wasn't obvious that the FF and VOLUME controls were the same button.* I expected the phone function to be a bit of a novelty, but it worked well enough to be used for &#34;quick&#34; conversations. A caller would notice the difference between using this as a speakerphone and a nice bluetooth headset, but it was sufficient for at least short conversations. Sound quality on the phone speakers was about as good as would be expected. The functionality of the PHONE button was pretty obvious.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* It has a pairing of red and blue LEDs to tell you when the unit is on/charging. I am a fan or dark, so more electrical tape.* The phone volume was a lot louder than the music volume. To be fair, I am not sure if this is some setting on my iPhone, or if it is just the way the units amplifier works. It didn't bother me enough to worry about trying to solve.* There is no obvious way to tell how much charge is left in the battery. I miss the battery meter than many of my bluetooth devices now seem to have.=== Summary ===* Despite my expectations of it being a gimmick, this is actually a useable device. I have it installed in my workshop, where it works quite well with an iPhone carried in my pocket. The phone, while not my first choice for long conversations, works well enough for quick hands-free discussion.=== Disclaimer===I received this product directly from the manufacturer as a sample.

The bass is light; the mid-range is muddy, and it clips off the high-end sound. But, considering the price and the fact that it's a bluetooth speaker, it's certainly acceptable. Just don't expect Jawbone-level sound quality, despite the name being referenced in the product listing.I do like the overall design. The case is made of a soft, rubbery material that feels nice and, more importantly, is 100% non-slip. You can put this on a steep incline (such as the control panel for a treadmill) and it will not budge whatsoever. The color is a vibrant blue, which looks nice, and the grill is metal (or at least it feels like metal) with an embossed diamond pattern. It's also compact, measuring only about 6 inches long, 1.75 wide, and about 2.25 tall. That makes it easy to take along, but no doubt contributes to the average sound quality and light bass.Unlike other low-end speakers it includes a slot to take a TF card (a microSD card) to play music directly from it. I don't have such a card handy, so I was not able to test that feature.But all those good points are marred by one really annoying one: it speaks (or rather shouts) its bluetooth status. So, when you first turn it on, a man's voice states \"Bluetooth model has been opened.\" At least, that's what I think he's saying - it's heavily accented English.I can't find a way to turn that off, or even make it softer. It's funny the first couple of times, but quickly becomes a real annoyance.While the features make this a decent performer for the price, and I love the casing material, the loud, annoying voice drops this to 3 stars.*** UPDATE: The manufacturer contacted me and provided me with a way to cut the volume of the announcement. Basically you need to update the unit's firmware using an SD card (download the code onto the card, insert the card, turn on the speaker, and let it be until it has updated).  I have to give the manufacturer credit for following up and addressing the issue.  Based on the update, I changed my rating for the product to 4 stars since the update addresses what was for me a major annoyance. According to the manufacturer, new versions of the speaker will come with the firmware already updated. It's nice when a manufacturer follows-up and improves product performance - kudos![Sample provided for review]", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great case; average sound; one big annoyance (but a fix is available)", "unixReviewTime": 1382659200, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2013"}

The box is a mere 6\" x 2.25\" x 1.5\".  Its rubberized top and bottom give it a sturdy, matte look while the black metal speaker grate in front protects the interior.  It charges with a mini (not a micro) USB port, and has an on/off switch to conserve battery life.  On the top, there are phone answering, forward, back, and pause buttons.  As expected, pairing is easy as long as you know to look for BIGBox on your list of Bluetooth devices.  (Since I have paired many Bluetooth devices to my phone and iPad, I would have appreciated a more readily identifiable name such as MagicBox.)The sound is pretty good, although not great.  At lower volumes, music sounds a little airy, but increased volume levels produce much higher quality sound, suggesting that this would appeal to those who like to crank up their music, especially since it is balanced toward the bass.  Even so, you shouldn't expect to shake the floor -- this is, after all, a small box designed for small spaces.  And you shouldn't expect high audio quality given its size and the single box format.  It's perfect, however, for a dorm room, small bedroom, office, hotel room, or anywhere space is at a premium.  The only thing I don't like about this -- and it's a feature found on most of its competitors -- is the loud, Bluetooth beep when it is turned on, ready to pair, or in the process of pairing.  The jarring sound ruins the experience for me because I'm anticipating my music, not a piercing beep.  Still, especially since everyone seems to do it, it's a small quibble.Given the price and size, the MagicBox seems ideal for a child's or teen's bedroom as well as for anyone who wants better sound for their smart phone, MP3 device, or tablet.

Many of them, however, compromise on the sound quality in order to be incredibly affordable. The DKnight speaker manages to get the sound quality that you would normally expect from much bigger brand-name speakers at the fraction of the price that those speakers sell for.One of the first things you notice about this speaker, and rightfully so, is its incredibly strong and crisp sound. The bass notes were rich and well shaped, and at high volume it was hard to listen due to its incredible loudness.Pairing with my iPhone was a breeze. Bluetooth has come a long way and it's now almost as good as any other wireless transmitting standard, especially for casual listening.The speaker is fairly well built. Th bottom and the top are rubberized, and they grip easily to almost any surface. The sides of the speakers are made out of metal grille and look pretty cool. There seem to be three different color options for this speaker, but to my eye the all-black looks by far the best. As already mentioned, this speaker is really small and it fits easily into almost any environment, especially when used in a completely wireless manner.The speaker uses a micro USB input for charging. You can charge it by connecting it to your computer, or by using a stand-alone charger. Charging speeds will depend on whether you are using the 1 A or 2.1 A charger, and it could take anywhere between two to four hours. Single charge is sufficient for many hours of listening, and it will (naturally) depend on how loudly you use it.The speaker has voice prompts for various states, which is a bit annoying. I would have preferred simple sounds.Overall, this is a great little speaker, especially considering the price.

Chambers", "helpful": [101, 118], "reviewText": "I so wanted to give the Magicbox a full 5 stars, and only one minor annoyance kept me from doing so. First of all, the audio quality is first rate to my ears, especially for such a small speaker. Sound clarity was excellent, bass notes were thumping without getting muddy, and the maximum volume was almost at the hurt-my-ears level. Pairing was quick, with the Magicbox being recognized as &#34;BIGBox&#34; by my Nexus 7 tablet. The controls on top of the speaker worked well to adjust the volume, pause the music, and to advance/go back in my playlist. As for the Bluetooth range, I moved the speaker around, and it played everywhere in my house, even upstairs, without any dropouts. I also hard-wired my Nexus 7 to the speakers with the included 18&#34; 3.5mm audio cable. It worked very well, but in this mode, the volume, pause, and forward/back must be controlled from the tablet or phone.There was just one small annoyance. Whereas most Bluetooth speakers use a simple tone and colored lights to signal that the speakers are ready to pair and when the Bluetooth connection is broken, the Magicbox uses a man's voice (English, with an Asian accent). Moreover, the voice was very loud. The manufacturer emailed me with instructions on how to lower the volume, and when I did so, the volume was lower, but it was still a little weird to use a voiceover instead of a beep to do this. The manufacturer says that they will correct this in new shippings.But that was the only negative issue I had with the Magicbox, although I should mention that the blue color looked a bit garish to me, so I recommend the black color.A USB charging cable is included, but I didn't see any charging information in the user manual. The 800mAh internal battery could be recharged from a USB port, but I also used a 5V~0.85A charger for an hour or so, and there were no problems.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First rate audio, just one small annoyance - 4 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1382918400, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2013"}

First the sound.  At full volume both on the device and my iPhone, there was no distortion and the sound filled a medium sized room with plenty of sound.  The highs were crisp, the mid-range was even and the bass was surprisingly solid.  There are two speakers inside and I wish I could open the box up to see how they are arranged. The two speakers are 1-1/2&#8221; wide (40mm) with 6-watt drivers.  Most Bluetooth&#8217;s are in the 2-4 watt range, so you get more power.

I want to first disclose upfront that I received a review sample.SOUND QUALITY: Excellent. My standard tests for speakers of any kind are are to play a few selected albums through it. I always start with Miles Davis'Kind Of Bluebecause it has high, mid and low range instrumentation. To my ears the album came through clear with all frequency bands distinct. Since that album contains only acoustic bass, I tried a few modern albums with heavy electric bass. To be honest some of the tracks I tried were a little thin, but considering the tiny speakers the sound was still impressive.CONSTRUCTION: I love the soft, rubber feel of the exterior of the speaker. I actually drop tested it to my carpeted floor from waist height and it did not affect it at all. Bottom line here is you can safely use this as an outdoors speaker - beach, hiking, etc. - without worrying about breaking it.FAVORITE FEATURES: I love the fact that I can insert a microSD card into the slot and play songs from it. I have a number of smaller cards with specific playlists, so that is a perfect feature for me. I tested a 32GB card and the device read it and played from it. You can cycle among connected bluetooth devices, directly connected devices via the 3.5mm port or tracks on your SD card with a push of a button.COMPATIBILITY: I tested this by streaming music from an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone and a Samsung Tab 3 tablet. I also streamed via bluetooth from my old Windows XP laptop via a bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle connected to my USB port. No problems pairing and connecting from any of the devices. Since I recently had a bad experience with a speaker that connected via 3.5mm ports I tested all of the above devices through their headphones out ports into the speaker. My bad experience with a different product involved a lot of static from certain devices, but this speaker was as clear as when connected via bluetooth or directly reading the SD card.Bottom line: this is a relatively inexpensive speaker with excellent sound and some nice features.

So you will need to use your own USB cable or purchase a new one for your device. Below are the reasons why I really am very pleased and will continue to use this charger:PROS+ Dual Ports - The first port which is the top one has more amp power because it is a 2 AMP source - this is the one that I charged my Tab 2 10.1 tablet in and also tried my Galaxy phone - each charged perfectly and FAST! (Note that I use on the top port the Mediabridge Hi-Speed USB 2.0 - (6 Feet) - A-Male to Micro-B Cable which I used this cable for better results and faster charging.+ Charging Time: On both devices (and using good USB cable), I found that from 30 percent to 100 percent both were charged in two and one half hours, which for charging both at the same time is exceptional. On my Samsung chargers it took me about three and one half hours to charge so I saved ONE HOUR and charged two devices.+ Works with so many devices - You just add your own USB cable for your device be it a phone or tablet, or music player and begin charging. The light is blue to show you it is charging. (It works with so many brands as iPhone, iPad, Kindle, Samsung Galaxy line, and many more!+ Small Footprint - So I placed this charger into the bottom outlet and still had room to plug in yet another single micro charger for my MP3 Player and all three devices charged at the same time!+ Travel Function - Because the plug prongs fold down flat, I place them in my travel bag with my two cables and am ready for travel. For me, I put all of this into a double zip lock bag in my purse so I have my dual charger set with me.+ Price - Think about it, this is TWO chargers for the price of one and a very high quality charger at that!+ Overall Use And Value - This charger works almost as fast as my original Samsung 2amp and 1amp chargers! And the fact that I usually charge overnight anyway so I did not notice any difference when I charged overnight. When on the go, I usually charge my tablet or phone in the car with a car charger so this dual charger is perfect for my home or when I travel to a hotel, etc.One last note: This unit was provided to me for testing, evaluation and for reviewing.

Inside the box was only the wall charger in a form fitting plastic insert to protect it. This is a fairly small, high powered dual port wall charger.  It measures 2.5\" x 2\" x 1\". It has two USB ports and provides a total output of 3.1 Amps. It has an Apple designated port producing 2.1 Amps and a Universal port producing 1 Amp.  It also has an blue power indicator light between the two ports. The prongs fold into the body of the charger for storage and travel. It appears to have a very good build quality.&#9830; Use and Performance - I plugged it into a wall outlet and did some testing to see how the wall charger handles simultaneous charging. I took my iPhone 5 that had 39% charge and my iPad 2 that had 66% charge and charged them simultaneously. I plugged the iPad into the 2A Apple port and the iPhone into the 1A Universal port.  After 10 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 49% and the iPad increased to 69%.  After 20 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 59% and the iPad increased to 73%.  After 30 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 68% and the iPad increased to 76%.  The iPhone charged at about 1% per minute and the iPad charged at better than 3% per 10 minutes. Some great results while charging two Apple products simultaneously. It did give off some heat when charging, but not too much.Conclusion:Overall, this is a great travel wall charger at this price point ($13 at the time of this review).  It has a large output capacity that charges multiple devices very fast. On top of that it is small and compact with folding prongs for storage and travel.

Perhaps not so in the case of 9to5's product. To my surprise and delight, this one is a well engineered, well designed and solidly built charger that does not scream 'cheap' and it doesn't look like it's about to break or to crack - which doesn't guarantee that it's not going to actually break or crack some day.One of the 2 charging USB ports is a dedicated 'Apple' socket for quickly charging Apple devices only while the other is labeled 'UNI', indicating that anything goes for that one, within reason. Both USB ports work with either Apple or non-Apple hardware but a non-Apple device through the Apple port may not be as efficient as using the UNI port. The charger plugs into your car's 'cigarette lighter' socket and once there it stays in solidly. The relatively small size helps it coexist peacefully with whatever may be in the cup holder next to it.This is what I like about the product:+ The listed 2.4 Ampsseems to be good enough to charge most 'small' electronics, at least those you are likely to use in a car. Had no trouble charging small MP3 players, a PSP, Kindle e-readers and our Kindle Fire through the non-Apple port and an iPhone through the dedicated Apple port. We no longer have an iPad so couldn't test it with Apple tablets.+ Dedicated 'Apple' (for fast charging of Apple gadgets) and 'Not-Apple' ports for everything else - see above for my tests.+ Everything that's listed as chargeable and I tested did charge.+ Good quality, solid build.+ Great design, small size, doesn't look or feel 'cheap'.I wish I could list a thing or two as a negative but other than the lack of a supplied charging cable can't think of anything else. And charging cables should not be reasonably expected at this price considering that they'd have to ship 3 standard USB cables (Type-B, Mini, Micro) plus one with an Apple connector to cover everything.Given the no real negatives and the product's good features, design and quality, this is a solid five stars.

If you are as confused as I am, it is intended to be Universal (UNI) for non Apple products, and APP is intended to support Apple products. I guess it makes sense (in a way). I am much more used to the ports being labeled 1.0 and 2.1 based on the Amps provided to the specific ports. My iPhone (Apple) uses 1.0 and my iPad (also Apple) uses 2.1.Whichever case, they both charge correctly, so I assume it is 2.1 amps for the Apple.I'm giving this four stars, not because it isn't a nice product (it is) but because the instructions for which one to use were unclear.The product information states that the total output voltage is 5V and the total output Amps is 2.4.

So the obvious question is why would you do that? As with most \"digital\" cables, I doubt that 95% of the typical users would ever see any difference in out-of-the-box performance of ANY USB cable. The only likely difference would be charging time on high current devices, and even that is a bit of a stretch. Digital signals, even for audio and video, are binary in nature. Either they are 100% correct, or the computer they are attached to yells that they are totally nonfunctional. (Yes, there could be some very slight issues with error rates and retries, but even those are unlikely).So why would anyone buy this cable? Quite simply, durability. Over the years I have learned to save myself a lot of cable headaches by buying decent quality cables. I don't go for monster prices, but I am more than willing to pay a couple bucks for a cable that won't be intermittent after a few insertions. As an aside, any new cable that comes into my house gets a \"yank test\". One or two good hard tugs so that if it is going to fail, it fails BEFORE it gets hooked up to something. A bit of an inconvenience upfront, but a big timesaver overall.These cables passed that test.=== The Good Stuff ===* They are certainly robust looking. They are thicker than the typical USB cable, perhaps the result of thicker gauge wire, but certainly a result of the cloth jacketing around them. In anyone has ever taken apart an old piece of electrical equipment, these wires will look familiar.* The connectors look to be well attached with stress relief built in. Looking down into the connector, there appears to be gold plating, but no idea how thick it is, which is the true measure of expected insertion count.* The cable I received was striped with blue and yellow. Not really a fan of the color combination, but it is certainly easy to pick out in the maze of white cables on my desk.* This cable is perhaps a little stiffer than the vinyl clad versions, but not enough to make much of a difference.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* They obviously cost more. If your USB application is something that gets plugged in once and never touched or moved again, these might not be the wisest investment.* Cloth cables are less able to slide over each other, meaning they can get themselves knotted up a bit easier than the more slippery vinyl.=== Summary ===I am a fan of more robust cables, even if the cost is higher. I place a value on my time, and spending all afternoon fighting with a loose cable, when I should be watching football, is worth something to me. I definitely believe that these cables are more robust, and therefore less prone to failure, then their cheaper counterparts. Based on your circumstances, your tradeoffs may be different.=== Disclaimer ===I received this cable as an evaluation unit directly from the manufacturer. I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the manufacturer, its employees, or suppliers.

The USB A Male end fits into your computer, or most charging adapters, and the Male Micro B end fits into a cell phone, or a Kindle, or an iPad, or any other smaller device.  Using this cable would allow you to charge your cell phone or Kindle or iPad or similar devices from your computer, or from a similar adapter that accepts a USB port. The same goes for transferring data from one to the other. I use a Kindle Fire HD, and the cable proved itself to be fine at transferring data rapidly.The advantages of a cloth-covered electrical cable are more than visual. The cloth covering is more durable and less affected by static electrical charges, and more resistant to kinks and tears than cheaper plastic covered wires are. (By the way, a six-foot cable is an optimum length: too short to be in the way, or have a great deal of unused cable to slow down transfer; and just long enough to connect units that are not on the same counter together.Visually, I was pleased with the coloration of my cable: an alternating brown and white pattern was attractive and didn't call attention to itself. It also felt heavier and more substantial than typical cables: the technical details specified it to be 2.0 gauge and gold-plated to boot. Heavier gauge wires mean more data transfer, more quickly, and that's good.Lacking the means and expertise to do so, I was not able to put this through any kind of a data transfer test and/or durability and endurance test. But as best I could see the connectors seemed substantially well put together and looked likely to hold up over time. It seemed as durable as claimed.I used this cable for all sorts of data transfer and charging, and I really felt that this was a substantial improvement over other cables. I was using a rapid charger, and the cable handled the load extremely well.I can't imagine you could find a better cable at the price. It comes with a two-year warranty.

That was the first impression and the cable continued to impress.That cloth colored jacket is not to give a cool, retro vibe, but has a valid electrical purpose. Most cables use PVC for the jacket and the dielectric properties will cause some signal distortion when they go through their store/discharge cycle. Granted, the amount of charge a PVC jacket will store and eventually discharge is minute and also will not affect charging. However, many of us use our cables to sync to laptops and other devices and with the cloth jacket this effect is so minimized as to be nominal.I love the heavy duty housing for the connectors and how they manage to be both thin enough to be unobtrusive and substantial enough to assure a long service life. There is even strain reliefs on each end of the cable to minimize wear that can eventually cause diminished transmission at the weak points in any USB cable. Whoever designed this cable thought of everything.Finally, the ends mate perfectly with every device with which I've tried them: on the micro end my Galaxy Note II, a friend's Droid, and a plethora of speakers and ear buds. On the USB end this cable fit my laptop, my Acer netbook and chargers and charger ports.

When I buy a cable, there is one thing I want: durability. I am tired of cables and cabled devices that fail after a few months (or less) of use because they are cheaply made, with fragile terminations or ultra-thin, easily torn, and poorly protected wiring.This Bolsa cable, thankfully, is not one of the above. Going back to an older day, it's cloth covered--- if you're really old enough you'll remember when everything was cloth covered--- this makes the cable less flexible than plastic covered units, but a lot more durable and a lot tougher and long lasting under constant use. The terminations--- the USB at one end and micro-B at the other--- are substantial (meaning not tiny and weak) and look well-designed to resist strain and the wear and tear of plugging/unplugging.Finally, the six-foot length makes the cable useful. No trying to make the cable reach; it's already long enough for any reasonable application. It's a little harder to store than the cheaper cables, but if you roll it into a loop you can stash it away conveniently. Just don't try folding it end-to-end; it's too stiff for that (and the stiffness is a good thing).The manufacturer says it uses heavier wire than most cables. I didn't cut it apart to verify this, but the feel is substantial and I'm sure the statement is true. The manufacturer claims this will give you faster charging and faster data transfer. Well ... maybe in theory (I'm an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering) ... but in practice, at the transfer levels we're talking about here, the claim is a little exaggerated. The real point, though, is that heavier wire will be more durable and much less likely to break. A broken cable transfers nothing at all.I definitely recommend this cable. It is way, way above average in the one way that you really want: it's not going to fail on you after a period of use and/or at some very inconvenient time like the middle of a road trip.

Sure, different companies put their logo on a given cable and the prices really fluctuate depending upon the brand, but when you get down to it, most cables come from a tiny range of manufacturers that actually build the cables.That said, there are some nice features that may be worth paying extra for. For one thing, the cloth jacketing on this cable from FRiEQ is nice because it really increases the durability of the cable. It's not as flexible as some plastic or rubber coated cables, but it will resist damage more effectively. Of course, you can still break this thing by being careless, but under normal usage, a cloth jacket will make the cable tougher.FRiEQ claims to use heavier wire, which theoretically leads to faster data transfer and quicker charging. Heavier wire should increase durability, but I would be shocked if there was a true noticeable difference. What *would* make a big difference is if this were a USB 3 cable (although, it's not really fair to say this because if you want a USB 3.0 cable, then you need to buy a USB 3.0 cable). I consulted a friend who is an electrical engineer and he was skeptical that there would be any noticeable speed improvement.The speed seemed fine in all my tests. I tried copying large files and batches of small files from a USB 2.0 hard drive to my Mac, and I also tried playing six simultaneous videos off of my hard drive. Granted, there are many factors that go into making this performance possible, but the important fact is that it works. Not an insanely scientific test, but it mimics the real-world situations that I run into every day (playing six simultaneous video files notwithstanding).It is handy to have a six foot USB-to-Micro USB cable around. I've got at least 20 little hard drives sitting around for various backup and storage reasons. They all use micro USB and they all come with tiny one foot cables. Now I have a nice, long cable to keep plugged into the back of my CPU. No more reaching around, trying to feel for where the USB port is, and then knocking stuff over on my desk. Sometimes it's the little things that make life so much easier ....Ultimately, I'm not sure that this cable is better in terms of data transfer rates than any other cable, but I do know that it's a good price, works well, and has the added benefit of a cloth jacket.

As you would expect from such a device, it can hold a LOT of juice. I've tested it with several small and medium electronic devices, which I had previously completely depleted. I was able to fully charge first generation iPad, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, Galaxy S3 and iPad Mini - all from a single charged Frosted Box F1 and with plenty of leftover charge. I have not tested it with the latest generation iPad Air, but my guess would be that Frosted Box F1 would be able to fully charge it at least three times.The battery comes with its own power supply and all the cables you'd need in order to connect it to most PC laptops. I've tested it with two of my older laptops - an Acer and an HP models - and it was able to fully charge both of them. As you can expect it charging a biggish laptop can take a while, so this is not a battery that will get you to full charge in an instant. Fortunately it can still be relied upon to power your laptop while its own battery is being charged. I've also discovered Frosted Box F1 takes a really long time to charge - I recommend having it charged overnight.Unfortunately, I have not been able to use this power bank to charge Mac laptops. It doesn't come with cables and connectors that will enable it to connect to a Mac. This is not just the problem with this battery - Apple is notorious for being very proprietary with their accessory connections, and I don't think there is an independent battery manufacturer out there with a product that will work with Macs. There are some hacks that will allow you to get around this restriction (you can buy an Apple power cord or appropriate one from your old charger), but all such tricks require certain level of familiarity with electronics and willingness to improvise.If you have any &#34;regular&#34; PC laptop, chances are that this battery pack will work with it. The battery supports several different voltage outputs (5V and 19V) and comes with a gazillion adapters that can fit pretty much any laptop power input that I've come across.This is a beautifully made external battery. Its metal casing is stylish, elegant and very sturdy. It is, as you would expect it, fairly large and heavy. It weighs 634 grams (not including the power brick) or almost a pound and a half. This may not be an ideal emergency battery that you carry with you everywhere in your messenger bag, but it is a great backup resource to have if you find yourself on a long business trip or vacation. In many respects this is a standout product that is in a class of its own.One last caveat: batteries of this size can get pretty hot.

Newell \"Bob\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "The 20000 mAh power pack and the 30000 mAh pack are reviewed together here, as I found similar observations apply to both. Where there are important differences, these are noted. I received samples from OXA for review purposes, but as you will see, my reviews are independent and straightforward.The idea of these high capacity power packs is to provide power for a laptop, well in excess of that which would usually be provided by the laptop's battery. The power packs are more or less portable; that is, the whole thing, including charger, will go into a travel bag or briefcase, but it will take up some room and add some weight. If you are on a day trip and leave the charger home, it's much more portable, but still not feather-light; power packs with this much juice has got to have a least some density and weight.Why would you need such a power pack? Wouldn't a spare battery do as well? Probably not; the power pack will give more than double the power of a typical single battery, and will do so without interruption or the need for a shutdown, battery swap, and restart.These battery packs, as noted above, comes with its own charger, and charges from the bottom in about three hours (not one hour as advertised in the little instruction sheet). Other accessories include a large selection of plug tips. It's very likely that one will work with your laptop. You push the tip onto the end of the supplied cord. One end goes into the laptop and the other into the &#34;out&#34; port of the power pack.On the 30000 mAh pack, you press a button to turn on the juice and then set the output voltage. You will want 19 volts for a laptop, but other voltages are available for cameras and other devices. A series of four LEDs shows the state of charge of the pack in a very approximate manner.THe 20000 mAh pack has no voltage selection and no need to press a button to start it. There is a button to press to check the state of charge, as very roughly indicated by a series of four LEDs.Both packs offer 5-volt USB output for charging phones and tablets. OXA says there will be less efficiency using this output, but I didn't find a great difference, though it's fair to say I spent the majority of my time testing with laptops. I don't think you'd buy these packs to charge phones and tablets (though you could); there are better alternatives.The real question is: just how much run time do you get? I struggled with this and ended up doing significant testing with an older Acer laptop, complete with add-on laptop cooler, a combination that draws significant power, much more than with a new and much more efficient unit.The Acer runs for an hour (that's it!) on its 7500 mAh battery. So, if efficiencies and residual power levels are roughly the same for the Acer's battery and for the OXA power packs, the 30000 mAh unit ought to get 4 hours of run time and the 20000 mAh unit ought to get just under three hours. But I didn't get that. I got 3 1/2 hours and 2 1/4 hours, respectively, and these results were quite reproducible over multiple tests (I spent a LOT of time on this).What was wrong? I contacted OXA and told them my results were showing the packs didn't give the expected output. They sent me some stats about efficiency and residuals; the packs are about 66% efficient, which is not impressive (I expected more like 75%), and would &#34;quit&#34; with about 6% of their power remaining (pretty typical).It took me a while and I got the answer, which should have been obvious, but if you buy one of these packs, it's something important for you to take into account.When using these packs, the laptop thinks it is on AC power, not battery power. It will therefore use a power profile that is less conservative, and run times are reduced. I found that this accounted for the discrepancies I was seeing.What it means to you is that you should retune your AC power profile to look more like your battery power profile when you're using these power packs. It will give you 15-20% more run time, maybe a little more depending on your settings.There was one other interesting observation. You should try running with both the internal battery in place and with it removed. Results depend on the laptop; I got different results with different laptops and it was hard to generalize. What this is all about is the power packs having a shutoff feature. They will shut off if there is no load on them for a short period of time. This means that if the laptop battery is in place, and not much is going on, the power pack may shut off and you've got to unplug it and plug it back in again. Doing this repeatedly is a hassle.On the other hand, one of my units would not start with only the 20000 mAh pack in place. I had to have the laptop battery to get it started. The power pack kicked in after startup. I have yet to figure this out.Before you take either of these packs on a &#34;critical&#34; outing, I strongly urge you to do your own experimentation at home, so you know what works and what doesn't. You especially should do a measurement of run time, as this is hard to predict. And be sure to take along a laptop battery, just in case.I give these packs four stars (same rating for both). You may think this is an over-rating, and perhaps three and a half is a better estimate of value, but these can be incredibly useful. I get several hours at a coffee shop with my old Acer, without the need to find an outlet; it's made it usable again as something other than a desk-bound unit.I can run my netbook all day long with these packs, a great thing when on a long trip with lots of hours on an airplane, airport layovers, etc.So I'm rating these mostly on utility. But there are the quirks mentioned above. (I could also have mentioned the instruction sheet, which is written in the most unintelligble gibberish English I've ever seen.)Four stars for high utility, one (or more) off for usage issues.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "High utility; requires attention to usage quirks", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2014"}

Lerch", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "The OXA 30000 mAh battery is designed to charge your laptop, tablet or cell phone. For phone charging, let's get something straight - 30000 mAh is probably MASSIVE overkill and you are spending money for something that you can use, but there are less expensive options available. To be clear, an iPhone 5s is something along the lines of a 1500 mAh battery. If you had 100% efficiency in charging (you don't - it's the nature of battery charging of ANY kind, not just OXA), you would have TWENTY recharge cycles for your phone. Let that sink in. For some people, that would be 20 full days of recharges. That's just... insane. If you want this for your phone, I hope it's because you will be doing some crazy travel, say the African Savannah where power isn't readily available. Otherwise this is overkill.Where this battery is NOT overkill, and where you are likely to get a fair amount of use from it, is for laptop or tablet charging. For an iPad Air, which sports an 8000+ mAh battery, you could easily get three full charges from the OXA 30000 mAh behemoth. That's a lot of recharges for a lot of time you can spend on your iPad. The other place this battery comes into its own is charging your laptop. The 30000 mAh is generally less than one full laptop charge, but if you are spending time on a plane or other travel and trying to work, and you routinely go longer than your laptop's battery can handle, you might just find this OXA battery can eke out the last remaining of hours you are spending on the plane with an active and live laptop. It's a life saver in these situations.Included in the box are adapters to plug into your laptop. There is one for Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, Acer, Toshiba and Sony. If you have a Samsung laptop, there are adapters available and I believe you could get one at a local Radio Shack if needed. This means you have everything you need in the box (assuming you have one of the supported models) to charge your battery during your travels.If you just want to charge a phone, be sure you have a real need for something of this capacity given the price. If you have the need for charging a laptop or tablet, then this device will likely be within your short list of things to purchase. It works well, charges quickly (well, relatively) and offers a lot of usage.Highly recommended if you have the need.I received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wait--- what? 30000 mAh?

Today's newest smart phones, like my Galaxy Note 2 and Asus T100 tablet, ship with a 2 amp charger and require 2 amps to charge them effectively, so with this charger you'd have issues if you needed to charge two high energy devices at once. You can still use the 1.2 amp port to charge a high consumption device, it will just charge more slowly, or simply maintain the current charge.Why did I only rate this charger three stars is it lives up to its advertising? The answer can be summed up with a single word... VALUE. Yes, this charger does indeed perform as promised, but similar products, one of which I just reviewed yesterday, are being sold for 20% to 50% less than this charger. For many people this charger will do just fine, but if you are looking to charge two high energy devices at a time, you might want to look at a charger that puts out at least 2 amps to each port. With the competing product I recently reviewed, I felt it deserved 3.5 stars, but rounded the score up to four because I felt the product was competitively priced for what it offered. The NukePak charger puts out 1/2 amp less, and at the time of this review is priced nearly 50% higher.

First, is the lanyard with the keyring. It looks and feels strong, and was intelligently designed to allow the battery to hang clear of a steering column when your car key is in use. I do think it could be a little beefier though. Another improvement I would love to see is a built-in flashlight like some battery packs have.

I didn't actually measure the output currents of the ports, but they seem sufficient for the devices they claim to support.* The unit seems to be finished well. The outside is a nice, smooth plastic, There is a yellow/orange LED that lights up the oval shaped indicator on the top of the device. This light comes on whenever the unit is plugged in. The glow of the LED also shines through the USB ports, which make them easy to find in low-light conditions.* The power supply is built into the unit, meaning no big wall-wart to plug into the wall, it is a standard plug. The unit comes with a five-foot power cord, which is about right. It accepts 110/220 volts, so it should travel well.* While the unit is a fairly good size, and has some heft to it, it is relatively flat, so it packs well into a suitcase of computer bag. But the cord does take up as much room as the charger.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* There is no practical way of shutting off the light. Even if you tape over the yellow oval, light still leaks through the USB ports. This is problematic, at least for me, in bedrooms and hotel rooms. I like to sleep in the dark.* My application for this unit is to affix it to my entertainment rack so that it can't move or fall. For that application, I would have preferred the 5 ports to be on one side of the unit rather than 3, and it would have been nice to have some way of mounting it (screw holes). For just sitting on the table, the unit's arrangement works fine.=== Summary ===The unit seems well designed and made, and so far has performed as advertised.

One day a baker slipped and left his door open, and when the salesman appeared he feared the worst. But the salesman said he had nothing to sell; since he was about to travel through nearby hills he only asked if he could drop off a grandfather clock and come back for it on his return a week later. Well, the townsman thought and thought and could think of no way this could hurt him, as he had no need for a clock. So he accepted the timepiece as long as the salesman promised to pick up the clock upon his return.Well, during the first few days the baker cared little for the clock, taking notice of it only when it chimed the hour. But soon he found that he began to predict the when the clock would chime, and before long he grew to expect it, and finally he counted on it. By the time the fourteen days was over he was timing when the sun would rise, then how long his bread baked, when he went to bed and when he woke up.  As you can guess, when the time came for salesman to return the townsman practically begged him to sell the clock to him&#8212;of course, he could no longer do without it.I bring up this story because, well, my experience with the Bolse went a bit like this. When it arrived I thought it a bit extraneous: after all, don&#8217;t all the electric devices I own &#8211; my smartphone, my Kindle Fire, and so on &#8211; come with their own chargers. Wasn&#8217;t a thing like this a little unnecessary?This might be true; the devices do have their own chargers. But setting them is only one inconvenient aspect of them&#8230;finding a socket that will accommodate several at a time, and at the right setting, is not always an easy task. Not to mention KEEPING all of those chargers around, and accessible, and using them for the correct device, and so on&#8230;In the case of the Bolse 40W (5V/8A) 5-port USB wall/desktop charger, the task is made simpler. Just plug this into a wall socket and five ports await. And they&#8217;re labeled, so there is no problem with identification&#8230; two are labeled universal; two are labeled iPad and the final one is Samsung (the final three are also universal).And they&#8217;re fast. Every time I hooked up my smartphone, or any other cellphone, or my Kindle, or any other device, the charging went extremely quickly. I was very impressed, and believe that the charging went every bit as rapidly as it did with the device&#8217;s original charger. And it charges several devices at the same time, just as fast.Another thing I liked about the Bolse is the simple and elegant design: it&#8217;s a sleek, compact device in basic white that fits anywhere &#8211; the floor, desktop, on a counter&#8230; It has a five-foot cord, so one doesn&#8217;t have to worry if the socket is just a little too far away. And while it&#8217;s charging it has a bright yellow light that is easy to identify.Anyway, it&#8217;s a great little device that looks and works great.

Inside the box was the charger, a power cord and an instruction manual.  The charger has a clean desktop design with a decent length cord and little rubber feed on the bottom.  It has a total of 5 Ports and 8 Amps of charging power.  It has 2 iPad Ports, 1 Android Port, and 2 Universal Ports.  In addition, all ports are marked as \"Universal\".  It appears to have a nice build quality.&#9830; Use and Performance - I plugged it into a wall outlet and did some basic testing to see how the Bolse wall charger handles charging multiple devices.I plugged in five devices as follows:- An iPad 2 in an iPad port.- An iPad Mini in an iPad port.- An iPad Mini in a Universal port.- An iPhone 5 in a Universal port.- A Bluetooth speaker in the Android/Universal port.I checked the charging speed at found after 10 minutes the iPhone added 11% charge, the iPad 2 added 3% charge, the iPad Mini in the iPad Port added 4% charge and the iPad Mini in the Universal port added 3% charge.  I checked it again after another 10 minutes and the iPhone added 10% charge, the iPad 2 added 3% charge, the iPad Mini in the iPad Port added 4% charge and the iPad Mini in the Universal port added 3% charge.  Very fast and very consistent results for so many devices charging at the same time.  Speeds were right on average for chargers that I have tested.  The one interesting thing was that the iPad Mini in the iPad port charged faster than the one in the Universal port.  Not a surprise, just something to note.  I also tested the iPhone and it charged in all ports and I tested both the iPad 2 and the iPad Minis and they charged in all ports except the Android port.  The charger did get warm during testing, but nothing out of the ordinary and stayed cool when plugged in but not charging.Conclusion:Overall, this is a great charger that offers a lot of flexibility, power and speed for charging many devices at once.  This has a good balance between power and size with great design.  It is really a great solution if you have a ton of power hungry devices like I do with three iPads to keep charged.

This Bolse charger solves that problem, providing 5 USB outlets in a single device.  I have tried other similar products from travel charges to other 5-output chargers, but the Bolse is probably one of the best ones I have tried.First, the total device can supply 40W of power.  What does that mean to you?  If you have another charger with the same number of ports, it means that it might not be able to use all 5 ports at once.  An iPad requires 10W to charge at regular speed and an iPhone requires 5W.  I have seen other devices with 20W-30W of charging power, which means that despite having two iPad ports, they can't really charge two iPads and an iPhone.  With the Bolse, you get two ports for an iPad, one for a Samsung, and two universal ports.  I was able to charge my iPad 4, iPad 3, iPhone 5S, Plantronics Headset, and Garmin watch simultaneously on this one charger, an impressive feat.The charger itself sits flat on your desk on 4 rubber feet, and plugs into the wall with a normal power cord (thank you!).  The cord is secured with a velcro strap.  Another great feature is that the Bolse charger has an LED indicator of power - many competing products do not.  Even better, the LED indicator is not so bright it lights up a room (it is a deep amber), so you can even keep this in a bedroom.The charger is a little bulky for travel, but Bolse does make a nice 4-port 20W travel charger you should consider as well.My only complaint (and why the 4 stars instead of 5) is that the two universal ports are on opposite sides of the charger.  This means that fully loaded, I have cables sticking out of 3 of 4 edges of the charger, making it a bit unwieldy.  I would far preferred to have all 5 ports on one edge so I could save space on my desk.

This was tested with a Samsung Galaxy Note II at 50 percent, an iPad and iPhone 4S at about the same levels, and two brand new 2400mAh battery packs out of the box. The Note II and both Apple devices fully charged in about the same time it would have taken using their OEM chargers, and the battery packs were fully charged in less than an hour.I've reviews more than my share of multi-port chargers and have never seen results like this. More importantly the body of the unit did not get hot (or even moderately warm.) While I loved the fact that this will fully charge five devices at once, I especially like the fact that the design includes electrical protection for over voltage and current, and short circuits.Another thing I appreciate is all of the ports are marked for specific brands, but also can double as universal ports. I have other multi-port chargers that have Apple specific ports, but it was never clear that I could use them for other devices. On this one every port will work with practically any 1A or 2A device except the Samsung port that will not work with an iPad.There are two 1A ports, plus three 2A ports (two for iPads and iPhones or universal and one for Samsung tablets).Physically this is a large unit at over 4.5x2.5 and 1.18 inches. However, it's not a wall wart because it has a heavy-duty cable that is just a tad short of five feet long. For me the size does not detract from this charger because it's easy to tuck out of the way. Plus in the open it's actually attractive.The main thing, though, is this will simultaneously charge five devices at full charging rate as claimed. And it does so with some built-in electrical protections that many other chargers that I have tested lack.

Using it is much easier than stooping/crawling to use the wall-plugged USB chargers in my home office.The yellow power-on LED is a welcome change from the glaring blue LEDs that seem popular on recent small electronics. The flat design is nice (I set my laptop mouse on top of it when I'm not using it). It also comes with a flat power cord. The power supply is internal (no wall-wart, and a normal plug into the wall) and the 100-240V input means a simple pin-change would be enough to use this unit during your global travels.According to a power meter, I was able to draw a respectable 5-6W simultaneously from each of the Samsung and Universal ports (tested against a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and a Motorola Moto G), though the amount tapers off as the battery fills up. Although some amount of AC power is lost in conversion to DC 5V, those numbers make the 40W specification seem achievable if you're charging tablets on the 2A ports.My only real complaint is having ports on 3 sides of the unit (and power cord on the 4th side). If both universal ports were on one side (instead of one on each side) I'd be able to push the charger back against the the wall. Since I don't usually use more than 3 ports at a time, this isn't a big deal, but still non-optimal.Other thoughts: The Samsung/Apple ports aren't as well explained as I'd like-- they're designed to provide higher power flow when they detect certain types of devices on the basis of a particular USB signal. A per-port LED showing that the device is drawing power would be nice, even nicer would be some indication that it was drawing power at the \"higher\" setting.[ I was given this product to review.

I have done this sort of thing and it makes life much simpler.So why 4 stars, not 5? One reason: the power cord doesn't fit well into the unit, and if you don't push it in really tight, or disturb the unit very much, it will pop out, and that's quite annoying if your devices suddenly aren't charging.

As a standard cable there really isn't any thing negative to say because it's just a cable.However from a design stance,  I see two flaws. The first flaw is the led thickness.  It's so rich that it won't fit to all phones with thick cases. I tested this on two different cases.  The thin black case was able to charge just fine without any issues.  The thick case I used next was too thick and it wouldn't connect fully.  I had to remove the case in order to charge it. This I can see is a major nuisance and I personally wouldn't use it if I had to take my case off if I need to charge it every day.  I buy a case for protection and looks.

The LED light is mostly blue, but every now and then it flashes red. I suspect the Nexus 7 is keeping the power topped off, hence the occasional red flash. I think it's really pretty cool. UPDATE: I hooked it up to my USB power meter and can confirm that it is flashing blue/red because the Nexus 7 is dropping to near 0 power for a bit, then jumping back up to about .2 amps for a bit, so it's working correctly.Note that when the cable is not plugged into a device, it still lights in blue, showing that the cable is plugged in and ready to charge. It also makes the cable easy to find in the dark.Overall 5 stars.

Nifty enough, but does it work?  To find out, I borrowed a pair of iPhones, a iPad, and an iPad Mini.  As I pretty much expected, the cable performed it's job just fine across all four devices.  And also as expected, given Zeetron's own admission to it, proper fit with cases was a variable.  The housing at the tip is just a little too fat for the opening in some cases.  That leaves a few choices - skip this cable, remove the case for charging, get a different case, or modify the case you have so the cable will fit.  I know which I would do (modify), but not everyone is going to be up for that.  As a unit, the cable is solidly made, and I have no concerns over its longevity and ability to take some abuse.

It plugged right into my iPad 4 which is clad in an extremely thin Amzer silicone skin jelly case, but my iPhone 5S in an Amazon Basics case did not work with the cable.  I had to remove my phone from the case to use the cable.  It would have been nice if Zeetron could have tapered the light-up end so it would work with most cases.  Second, the red for charging and blue when charged feature did not work with my iPod Nano 7th generation.  I plugged it in to charge, and while it does charge properly, the light stayed blue the entire time.  So the cable works fine as a cable, but part of the premium is the visual charging feature, and that doesn't seem to work with the iPod Nano.Overall, the cable is a fairly good price and the light up feature is neat.

Newell \"Bob\"", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "Zeetron has put out a USB to micro USB charging cable that tries to distinguish itself in a very crowded market. To some extent they've succeeded.The cable, suitable for use with many smartphones, tablets, and auxiliary devices, is white and about one meter in length, which is fairly typical. The build quality looks good; the cable is substantial and the plastic exterior looks strong. The usual point of failure--- the terminators at the ends--- look good, too. The cable should have an above-average service life with ordinary care.So what's different? In an interesting twist, Zeetron has put a light in the micro-USB end, at the very tip of the casing, where the plug goes into the smartphone or what-have-you. When the cable is plugged in (at the other end) to a USB charging source, the light is blue. When charging is happening (current flowing) the light turns red. On completion of charging, the light turns back to blue as current no longer is flowing.The genius of this is that you can see at a glance, from across the room, even, whether or not your device has finished charging. That's great if you're not charging overnight; the possible downside is that if the charger is in your bedroom (very typical), the glow may or may not bother you.That wasn't a problem for me. What I myself didn't like is that the blue light is always on when the USB end is connected to a power source, even after I've removed my phone. It's just sort of odd to see this unattached cable happily glowing blue at the end.What's the bottom line? If you don't care about stray lights and if you do want to see if your device is done charging without going over and turning it on, this is a great invention. Independent of the light feature, of course, it's a decent enough charging cable. So it's really up to you.Four stars for a solid product; it falls short of five stars because I'm not enthralled with the always-on light.Disclaimer: the company sent me a sample for review, but my reviews are 100% unbiased as I'm sure you can see above.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good cable; the light is a mixed blessing", "unixReviewTime": 1403568000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2014"}

Alternatively, if a device uses a micro USB charging cable but has no display to alert you to when it is fully charged, having a charging cable that offers a notification function is almost a necessity. In either scenario, Zeetron has stepped up and offered their version: the Zeetron Light up USB Cable.ConstructionI will not insult your intelligence by describing a charging cable. The Zeetron Light up USB Cable (or ZLU, for short) is 3ft long (91.44cm) with a standard USB adapter at one end and the elongated micro USB adapter at the other. It is the micro USB end of the cable that houses the two LED lights that indicate the charging status of your device; the housing for these lights is a very lightweight plastic that almost feels TOO light. While I haven&#8217;t done any experiments to determine what kind of force would be required to break/crush the micro USB adapter end, I can say that it endured abuse in a suitcase during a flight and still performed admirably, so the lightweight feel of the case is best taken with a grain of salt.Usage/FunctionalityAs the product description indicates, this cable is designed as an improvement upon other micro USB charging cables in that it shows you, via a combination of LED lights, the charge status of the electronic device that it is plugged into and charging. There are three basic indicators:1) Once the USB end is plugged in to the power source, but the micro USB end is NOT plugged into anything, the micro USB end will glow Blue to indicate the cord is receiving power and is ready to charge your device.2) Once the micro USB end is plugged into your (presumably uncharged) device, it will glow red, indicating that it is charging.3) Once your device has reached a 99% charge, the LED lights will alternate between Red & Blue flashing lights until the device is at 100%; at that point the light will remain solidly Blue.First and foremost, the ZUL performed exactly as described in the product description on this page. The micro USB adapter end of the cable lit up with no flickering. The stages listed above did occur, with the lighting turning Red, Blue, or flashing at the appropriate moment. In terms of the speed of the charging, I did notice my devices (one was a portable battery charger and the other my Samsung Galaxy S5 cell phone) charged a bit faster than usual, but I admit that this is a bit anecdotal and my observation was not done under rigorous test conditions.OverallIf you are looking for a charging cable that provides the convenience of knowing if your device is completely charged without having to walk over and pick it up to check the screen/some other indicator on the device, this cable is a great product. At 3ft (91.44cm) in length, it is long enough to snake behind a desk or a bed to keep out of sight, or small enough to slip into a bag for travel. The only complaint that I have is that the micro USB end of this cable does feel lightweight and that it could crack if it was crushed or otherwise had a bit of excess weight placed upon it. Since this is a relatively minor point, though, I still recommend this product and feel confident that you or a friend/family member will love this cable for any of your micro USB devices.**Disclaimer: This cable was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

This not only works well as a regular cable, but it's perfect for letting you know when something is fully charged (when it may not be totally obvious). Having the cable plug change from a red glow to a blue glow when the charge is complete is a great feature.There's two primary devices I use this cable on. The first is my Kindle. I like how I can use this light-up cable to tell when it's fully charged without having to open the case and check. The *very* useful &#34;use-case&#34; is on an external battery I have that uses LED lights to show how much juice is left. I charged it the first time with a regular cable, and unplugged when the battery showed four lights. However, I don't think it was fully charged as it only supplied two full recharges to my iPhone (and it should have been significantly higher). Using the Zeetron light-up, I just let it charge until the cable went from red to blue. With THAT as my full-charge indicator, I'm now getting the full number of recharges for my iPhone that I would expect. This cable was the difference between thinking I had a faulty battery and understanding that I was just interpreting the LED lights incorrectly.It's not always the case where I *need* this type of visual indicator.

A full charge will do just about one and a half full charges of an iPhone 4s. I was able to boost my iPad Air roughly 30% with a full battery charge.This is a well thought out battery. I like the flashlight on the end; it is very bright and slightly on the blue color side. Two presses of the power button turns on the flashlight. The silver power button is just hard enough to press that the light won't go on accidently, and at the same time I can easily press the button with my finger. There are four blue LED's to show the state of battery charge (the LED's are nice and dim like an indicator light should be). The battery has a standard microUSB charging port and a standard USB output, meaning it can charge anything you have a USB cable for.The battery is lightweight. It is the same length as an iPhone 4 and about twice the height. It is about one inch wide and nicely rounded. It feels really good in my hand.Charging was excellent with this battery. It charged both my iPhone and iPad at the highest charging rate. The battery will do a full 100% charge of an iPhone 4s, and then a bit more. This isn't the battery to charge an iPad, but in a pinch it can give a boost of about 30% charge (in a pinch that's pretty nice really).The box includes a few accessories. There is a neck lanyard (along with the required yellow EasyAcc advertising on the lanyard) and a short wrist strap made of soft fabric. They are both attached with that thin nylon thread loop trough material. There are two microUSB cables, one a short nine inches long and the other two feet long.

In any case, it's the smallest, lightest portable battery charger that I've personally used. With 3000mAh capacity, even allowing for normal electrical losses in the internal circuitry and cables, the charger should give at least one full recharge for cellphones, and perhaps half of a full charge for most 7\" tablets. That's enough to extend talk time or operating time by several hours. To test the charger, I used my Samsung smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD 7\". With the Kindle Fire, the charge increased from 56% to 88% in seventy-one minutes. Then I connected my phone, which charged from 74% to 100% in sixty-five minutes. These times are comparable to the results I've had with other portable battery chargers. At the end of that time, the battery charger still had enough reserve capacity to top off the charge on my wife's iPhone 4. To recharge the battery charger, I used an old Kindle AC adapter with an output of 5V~0.85A. The manufacturer recommends an input of 5 volts at 1 Amp maximum. Two USB cables with micro-USB plugs are included, but you'll need to use your own AC adapter (or recharge from a USB port on a computer).Like many other portable battery chargers, the EasyAcc U-bright 3000 uses a simple system of four LED lights to indicate its own charge state. It also has a very bright built-in flashlight. An unusual but welcome feature is an included lanyard that fits through a small opening in the case.The portable charger is ideal for someone who needs an occasional boost to extend their talk time or get a few more hours use from a tablet. It's not suitable for someone who's away from an AC power source or vehicle charger for hours or days (such as hikers and campers), but for the typical cellphone/tablet user, 3000mAh should be sufficient.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very compact portable battery charger suitable for many users", "unixReviewTime": 1384992000, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2013"}

Before I acquired the iPhone 5S I was using the Samsung Galaxy S4.  One of the many accessories I missed was the wireless charging capabilities the Galaxy S4 had.  You also were able to choose from so many different covers and cases that worked with the Qi receiver (wireless charging pad).  I checked what was out in the market for the iPhone 5 but nothing seemed to really \"fit\" what I was looking for until I had the opportunity to test the Unu Aero Wireless Charging Case and Pad.The case itself is soft to the touch and comes it two separate pieces.  It does a tiny bit of bulk and weight to the phone, but not too much to make much of a difference.  The case has raised buttons for the volume and power controls.  However, it has an open area for the mute switch.  Even though it does not have an open area in the bottom for the speakers, it  has two slots located on the front of the case for sound and microphone use.  The camera cutout on the back is quite large, so expect no interference troubles there.The receiver (Qi) pad is extremely lightweight and automatically begins charging you phone as soon as it makes connect with your phone.  Believe it or not, this charges faster the normal lightning cable.  I was so impressed with how fast it charges and how long it holds the charge, I ended up acquiring two additional charging pads to have in my office and another in my vehicle instead of using a lightning cable.  Keep in mind besides using the wireless pad to charge the phone,  you can always a  micro USB cable to charge the case as well in case of emergencies.  The only thing you really need to get use to is using a headset extension adapter.  Since the headphone jack sits far into case, a headphone plug will not be able to fit correctly.  I don't use the same headsets all the time, so I have to make it a point to remember to carry the included headphone jack adapter with me when I plan to use different headphones.One really great feature is the battery usage indicator located on the back of the case.  It has four tiny blue lights to tell you how much battery life is left.  It is pretty accurate too because I have the battery indicator on my phone and I am always comparing the two.When using it to sync to iTunes, you just need to use a micro USB cable instead of the Apple Lightning cable.  This way you don't have to take the case off.This is truly a terrific product and works great.  If you are interested in extra pads here is the link:uNu Aero Series Wireless Charging Pad (Single Mat). Like I mentioned before, I used one in my vehicle by placing it in one of the cubbyholes in my Dogde Durango - works great!UPDATE:Since I kept taking the case on and off to test and review other cases on my phone, I broke one of the tabs on my uNu Aero case and wanted to cry because this is my favorite and pretty much the case I use everyday.  I emailed customer service (services@myunu.com) and they quickly issued me a replacement.

This one, designed for the iPhone, tries to make a balance between adding size and being of value, while at the same time trying to work within the limitations of what what can do with the fruit of Apple.  I think uNu did a good job at meeting their goals with this product, but could have done a couple of things better.  The case itself is a nice snug fit, not easily dislodged once it's wrapped around your phone.  The lighting connector on the inside of the case lines up just right, and the fit is secure.  But for whatever reason, uNu decided against using a lightening connector on the outside of the case for charging and syncing, instead using the common micro USB.  This change doesn't reduce any functionality, but if one has invested in extra iPhone specific cables, those are useless once this case is on.  It makes sense for uNu's similar product aimed at the Samsung Galaxy 4, which already uses micro USB, but not so much with this.  Due to the limitations of the iPhone, no user removable battery, the uNu pack acts as its own entity for the most part.  If one reads the clearly written instructions, it's made plain that in order to use the extra battery, one must turn it on.  For those that...uhm...don't read instructions, it's not at all obvious.  The friend I asked to give this a try on her iPhone came back to me a couple days later all disappointed that it didn't work at all.  When questioning her, I found that she hadn't read the manual, just charged her phone like usual, and was expecting the extra battery life to work seamlessly.  Once she was shown how it was supposed to be used, it was a whole different story.  Now she's in love, other than needing to get some micro USB cables for when she isn't near the charging pad.  I agree that it would be nice if the whole things worked together a bit better.  Like maybe an app that could monitor the phone's battery and then kick on the extra one as needed.  My guess is though, not being an Apple developer myself, that Apple does not allow this level of access to the hardware.  Also worthy of note, when charging, the phone's battery charges first, then the external.  Always.  Further, the external battery has its own charge level indicator.  There is no other way to check if the pack is fully charged or only partially.

With my iPhone 5 losing power at a sometimes phenomenal rate, this case has saved me several times over the past week alone.The Aero weighs 2.75 ounces, and it adds about a half-inch to the phone's length.

This puts much less strain on the battery case and should extend the life of the battery.  This feature is not available on all battery cases.&#9830; Key Feature: This battery case has a \"sync-through\" feature that lets you sync your iPhone through the Micro USB cable. This means you do not have to remove the case to do a wired sync of your iPhone.  This is a critical feature, and a deal-breaker for me for cases that do not support this.&#9830; The case covers the headphone jack, so you will have to use the included headphone extension to use regular headphones.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in professional looking box with nice pictures and product information on it. Inside the box was the battery case, a charging pad, a Micro USB charging cable, a headphone jack extension cable and an instruction manual all wrapped in a form fitting plastic holder. It is a very nice looking battery case that doesn't add a lot of bulk to your phone, while giving you a nice battery boost. It has a matte finish that offers a little bit of grip.  The case is built more for protecting from light bumps and scrapes, not major drops. The back of the case has a power button to turn on the case battery, four capacity gauge LED's and two metal charging studs for the charging pad. Overall, it seems to have a nice quality build.&#9830; Installation - Installing the case was pretty easy. You slide your iPhone onto the Lightning Plug and carefully slide a frame over the phone to hold it in place. No problem at all and it had a nice fit.&#9830; Use and Performance - To activate the battery case, you press and hold a button on the back of the case and the battery turns on. My phone immediately indicated that it was charging and everything started working as expected. The battery did a great job of charging my phone with no problem and the case felt good in my hand. It was a little larger and heavier than I was used to with my typical Incipio Dual PRO Case, but not too much. The charging speed was great adding a little more than the average of 1% per minute of charge to my iPhone 5.  Overall, it worked very well.&#9830; Key Feature #1 (Charging)  - I have tested a few battery cases, and this one has some great features that were not available on the other cases I have tested.  First and foremost, it has a great wireless charging option with an included charging pad.  You just lay the phone on the charging pad with one of the charging studs on each side of the pad and it starts charging right up.  An important item to note about the charging.  The charging pad (or charging via the Micro USB cable) charges up the iPhone and the battery in the case separately with the iPhone being charged first.  This is different than some cases that charge the battery case only and you have to charge the iPhone with the case all the time.  Charging the phone separately puts a lot less strain on the battery case and should make the battery case last a lot longer.  This is a great feature of the uNu Aero case.&#9830; Key Feature #2 (Sync)  - The other cases I have tried do not allow you to sync your iPhone through the Micro USB cable.  That means you either have to rely on WiFi/Cloud sync, or you have to remove your phone from the case every time you want to sync it with a normal Lightning cable.  What sets the uNu Aero case apart from its competition is that it supports \"sync-through technology\" that allows you to sync your phone right through the Micro USB cable with the case still on.  This was a great feature that really made this an awesome case.  One item of note, the uNu Aero must come with a higher quality Micro USB cable, because a generic cable that I had didn't work for sync and gave me the unsupported device error.  When I plugged in the Micro USB cable that came with this case, it started working perfectly.Conclusion:Overall, this is an amazing case.  It does a great job of charging your phone, and it has some unique features that really make it stand out from the crowd.  It is not a case that will protect your phone from major drops, but it offers some basic protection and performs great as a battery case.  If you are looking for a battery case for your iPhone 5, this is the one to get because of the key features mentioned above.

In most instances, the protective case will keep your phone safe, but if you are prone to dropping your phone and stepping on it, you probably should look for a tougher case, (but you'll lose the slimness of the 5S by doing that). The case comes in two pieces, top and bottom/back, that snap--tightly--together to frame your phone. (With all the color choices that they show for the Galaxy, I would expect the color selection to expand for the iPhone, too.)--The battery is incorporated into the back of the case, how clever is that? And it is a potent, powerful battery at that. Even though it is part of the case, it is not secondary to the case: The battery charges quickly, holds the power, and provides enough oomph to keep your device going for an extra 10 hours. Cords come with the set.--The back of the case has two tiny silver metal \"bumps\" that act as connectors to the charging mat. Plus, you can buy additional mats and leave one at home and one at work, or wherever is convenient. Keep your mat plugged into a USB hub and toss your phone onto it to charge. You don't really appreciate how easy and convenient it is until you try it once!This is a top quality, well-constructed case and charging mat. Its design works with the look of your 5S, 5 iPhone or iPod, 5th Generation (latest). It is so convenient and effortless to charge up with this new uNu design. I love it, and highly recommend it!

The case itself comes in 2 parts.  You snap off the outer ring, slide your phone onto the included Lightning connector, and then snap the outer ring back into place.  The case itself has a rubberized outside and feels good in the hand.  The power switch and volume switches are covered with rubber, but there is a cut-out for the silent toggle.  The bottom of the case has a micro-USB plug, so an added benefit of the battery case is you can now charge your case and your phone without having a lightning connector nearby.One downside of the case is that the headphone jack is so recessed that most headphones won't fit in it.  The manufacturer provides a &#34;stub&#34; cable which you will need to keep with your favorite pair of headphones.I was also a bit surprised to find that the charging isn't wireless in the sense that it is inductively charged.  Instead, you get a pad with 2 metal contacts on it.  The back of the battery case has another 2 contacts on it.  When the two touch, the phone charges.  So in fact, it's not exactly wireless, but it plugs it with gravity instead of a cable.  In that sense, however, the system does work quite well.My only real complaint is that the case doesn't really bump out in front of the screen at all, providing minimal impact protection if you drop your phone on the screen.  If they were to add some lip in the front, this would be a perfect case.

The included charging platform enables you to charge your iPhone while in the case merely by placing it on the platform. It is wireless charging.A USB to MicroUSB cable is included and this is what you'd use to connect the battery case to your computer for charging/syncing. While your phone is in the Aero case, you no longer need a Lightning cable to charge or sync your phone. The case has a MicroUSB port on it and it is the MicroUSB that is now used for syncing and charging.The case is comprised of two parts: the battery/case and a frame. The iPhone5 plugs onto the Lightning plug at the bottom of the battery/case and then the frame snaps around the iPhone5s and connects both to the bottom battery/case. When everything is snapped together it is a very nice looking, integrated solution that protects your iPhone5s and acts as an attached battery.The battery has a 2000mAh capacity which is enough to basically double your normal iPhone5s battery life.The charging platform is sort of a bonus. It does not contain a battery and is used soley for charging your phone when it is placed on the platform, wirelessly. The platform has a MicroUSB port on it and when that is connected to a USB power source, it is ready to charge your iPhone5s battery whenever it is placed on the platform (while in the AERO case of course.)I like the appearance of this AERO case. It does not look like something added on to your phone, it looks like it came that way. I no longer have to wonder whether my iPhone battery will get me through the entire day now because my battery life has been doubled with the addition of the AERO battery case.

Not only does this significantly increase the battery capacity of an iPhone 5 or 5S, but the case affords more protection than other cases I have tested. This system was tested with an iPhone 5S.Here are the key features and advantages as I see them:EXTENDS CAPACITY: While the packaging indicates that this will double the use time of an iPhone 5 and provide 85 percent more for the 5S, the actual results are a little better than claimed. For the iPhone 5 the battery pack provides 138% more use time and for the 5S the figure is 127%. This is based on the fact that this battery pack adds 2000mAh (milliamps per hour) to the 1440mAh that the iPhone 5's battery has, and the same addition to the 1570mHa for the 5S.Note that increasing battery capacity increases use time, which is completely dependent upon how you use your phone. If you normally get ten hours between charges, with this battery you will at the very least double that for an iPhone 5 and add another minimum of 8.5 hours to a 5S. Those are conservative numbers that go along with the manufacturer's claims. In practice you will get more with a newer phone since the battery has not deteriorated from multiple charging cycles.FIT AND PROTECTION: The battery assembly is also a protective case with a soft synthetic back that cushions and absorbs shock. All of the cutouts are perfectly placed and all buttons and ports are available with the battery in place.Do note that the case is a two piece assemble that consists of a back (battery) and bumper that you snap in place after you mate your phone with the lightning connector. Once your phone is encased you will charge the battery with a standard micro USB cable (one is provided with this battery). This has pros and cons. On the plus side you can ditch the proprietary cable the iPhone 5/5S uses; on the minus side any investment you have made in extra lightning cables is negated.You can charge and transfer data simultaneously, which is a feature that sets this battery apart from the competition. Plus you can charge it via a computer's USB port. Not all batteries on the market will allow that - many I have tested would not charge that way.CHARGING MAT: An added bonus is the wireless charging mat that is included with this battery. It actually does work (I was a bit skeptical at first). In fact, it will charge up the external battery pack in almost the same time it takes to charge it via the micro USB connection from a regular charger. This adds not only convenience, but value because some of the iPhone batteries I have tested in the past were in this one's price range and did not include a charging mat.Overall this is a solution that is superbly engineered and manufactured. Everything from the precision fit of the battery case to the way this solution performs to or exceeds claimed specifications warrants a solid five stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding engineering", "unixReviewTime": 1387670400, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2013"}

However, I have found iPhones so fragile that I wouldn't think of using one without a case anyway, and this is less bulky than something like a waterproof Otterbox.  For a battery case, it is pretty thin and looks nice, if not super sleek.  Importantly, it is sturdy plastic and does a good job protecting the phone.To charge the phone, the case plugs into the phone's lightning port.  What I love is that, rather than sticking a lightning port on the case for charging or syncing, uNu went with micro-USB.  This is the universal standard for almost everything other than Apple products, so I have plenty of those cables around.What about wireless charging?  Well, it is not the usual Qi or similar standard of inductive charging.  In fact, it is a bit of a misnomer to call it wireless at all.  The charging pad consists of two metal plates with magnets.  The back of the case has two metal pins, which extend via the magnets to touch the plates.  So, it is basically using pins rather than wires, similar to a standard phone cradle.  With that said, it works well and I do like the convenience, apart from the magnets occasionally wanting to stay stuck and attach the mat to the phone.  The downside is that a standard wireless charging mat will not work with the phone, so if you already have a nice one for your gadgets, that could be something to consider.Overall, the uNu Aero series case is an impressive and simple way to keep your iPhone safe and juiced up.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not Too Bricky, A Bit Sticky", "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014"}

The UNU Aero Wireless Rechargeable 2000mAh External Battery Case and Charger Pad for iPhone 5 and 5S is an excellent system, providing substantial additional power to the iPhone PLUS it is a wireless way to recharge both the iPhone and its charging case by placing it on a charging pad. After having already tested a couple of these general type chargers from competitors, this is the best iPhone 5/5S charger, so far. The 2.6 ounce Aero case unit adds one half inch in length to the iPhone and consists of a nice 2 piece protective battery case which contains a 5 volt, 2 amp (the Aero case tag cites 500mA) input/5 volt, 1 amp output max 2000mAh capacity reserve power rechargeable battery for the iPhone from within its surrounding protective case: the manufacturer claims 6 hours additional talk time and 8 hours of video playback from the case battery. On the back of the case, there is an`on' button and '4 blue LED status lights' showing charging status of the case battery itself. When both the iPhone power and the case power are depleted or when a full charge is needed, the phone can simply be placed on top of the included Aero wireless \"charging pad\", which itself is connected to a power source via its micro USB to USB cable: I hooked the \"charger pad\" to a standard A/C wall connection via an Apple USB/AC plug (not included) for faster charging.Right out of the box, I easily mounted the iPhone into the 2-piece snug-fitting case, pushed the \"on\" button, felt the iPhone vibrate twice, and the case battery charged a fully power-depleted iPhone up to 43% of capacity and stopped charging at that point. Then I placed the phone onto the charger pad to continue charging the iPhone, and the power percentage immediate jumped from 43% to 49% and continued to charge to 100%. At that point the battery case had only 2 LEDs of the 4 lit, so I continued the charging process until all 4 LEDs were lit; the entire charging process for both was about 6 hours. Conclusion: the battery in the Aero case charges AFTER the iPhone battery is fully charged, so users should continue charging the Aero case to 4 light capacity. I then depleted the entire power of both the case and the iPhone battery and repeated the process by stressing the charger and iPhone: I looped my iTunes library and music played continuously for 33.2 hours. Since the iPhone lightning adapter port is hooked directly to the Aero case power supply, access to the iPhone for 'iTunes computer syncing' is through a provided cable. The manufacturer also provides a headphone extension cable because while inserting the headphone plug is no problem, removing the headphone plug could damage the cable wiring. Highly Recommended. 5 EXCELLENT Stars! (UNO Aero Battery Case, Charging pad, micro-USB to USB charging cable, Headphone extension cable, instructions on the box and a separate users manual sheet.

It does add weight to the phone, since you can't really get more battery power and not add weight, but it's evenly distributed over the surface of the case. The case itself seems to melt around your phone. One down side you MIGHT have is that now you can't see the Apple logo or the color of your phone. Yes, it's something silly, but if you buy a phone with color to it, don't you want to show the color off instead of covering it in black? For me, this is inconsequential as a useful phone with a charged battery is more important than the &#34;form.&#34; Function over form for me.The battery itself is 2000 mAh which means you get just a touch more than a full charge added to your iPhone. This should be enough to get just about anyone through an entire day, whereas without I was finding that I would get about 6-9 hours of use before needing a charge, and right around 10 hours before the phone died.

Ultimate in lazy convenience, since now I don't even need to bother trying to plug the phone in at all.To charge your phone, you must press a button the case to begin feeding power to the iPhone. This is fine with me, and I believe this is as designed so that the battery case isn't providing a constant trickle charge which can shorten the life span of the batteries.One down side is that while charging the phone, the battery can become pretty warm.

It's extremely small and lightweight -- it's not much bigger than a credit card in any dimension but depth, and there it's about as thick as a two or three of them. If you're ever in an emergency and you think of how cheap and easy-to-use this product is, it's no doubt you'll wonder why you didn't buy it.While it's tiny and is indeed billed as an emergency charging solution, understand that this little Sabrent is more than a \"last-ditch\" device: it will provide you with hours of extra cell phone life. It's rated at giving four more hours for ordinary cellphones, and three more hours of use to a smartphone. And, naturally, your phone can be used WHILE it is being charged, so there's no waiting (unless your phone has to reach a minimum charge level first).And, as I mentioned, Amazon is selling these at quite a savings at the time of this review: about $10, delivered (if you have Prime). That's an EXTREMELY respectful price: I have two daughters, and I know can only imagine how mad I'd be at myself if my two daughters were to be left without a phone when such an economical and easily transportable device is available.  As it can fit wherever three or four credit cards can, this is an extremely practical wallet or purse-sized device that can save you immeasurable hardship if you are left without a phone.And, as the pictures at the top of the page display, it doesn't require any link-up cables: the links are provided within the tiny charger.It also comes with a tiny flashlight (or \"torch,\" if you're British). If it's lying flat with the SABRENT logo on top one activates it by pushing the switch away from the \"S\" and toward the \"T\" it's activated by turning the power switch to the right when it's facing AWAY from you. (While the light won't exactly light up the night, it WILL burn holes in your retinas if you point it at your eyes.)The only problem I really see with this is in the charger's connectors: While they are not flimsy, the contacts are relatively small and look as if they might be subject to any consistent wear. (Pass your zoom bar over the photo at the top of the page that displays the extended filaments and you'll see the wear the display product has undergone.)

The price point is also a great one though I wouldn't imagine paying more than about $10 for this one.To the negative side, it must be stated that this is purely an emergency unit that's not likely to withstand frequent use.  While the design is clever, it's cheaply made and isn't going to hold up over time.  Also, the battery does seem to hold a charge fairly well when disconnected but it's only going to be good for a couple of calls if your phone is truly dead.

The input uses a micro USB cable, and the output hooks up using a standard USB cable. A cable is provided, but I considered it the only weak link in this product...more on that in a  second.Here's the basics (which is about all I can explain, electrically): there are three ports, one of which is an input port, and charging an uncharged battery charger will take about 5-6 hours. The other two are output ports: one that is labeled \"Output 1A\" and another that is labeled \"Output 2.1 A.\" Both output ports fit a standard USB (female) cable, whereas the input uses a micro USB cable. About a foot-long USB to micro USB cord is provided, but it was, quite frankly, of pretty lousy quality - unlike the rest of the unit. The standard USB cover fell off the second time I used it, just as I was bragging to my wife what a great charger this was. And it took me a minute or two to get the darned thing off once the plastic cover slid off its housing. I almost immediately threw it in my \"USE ONLY AS A LAST RESORT\" drawer.Back to the output of the charger: the total output is listed at 3100 mA, or 3.1 amp hours, but that would take using both the output ports hooked up to separate devices. I think this is a viable option if you are charging smaller units, but I would not try charging, say, a smartphone AND an iPad at the same time and expect similar speeds. A nice feature is that it shuts itself off when the device it is charging reaches its limit. No overheating.As to those speeds and capacities: the unit can charge smartphones by the half-dozen, one after the other, and maybe more...and that's not a stretch. Or, it can charge a couple of Kindles - that is, a fully charged Sabrent 120000 mAh can do so. I do not have any concept of whether it can charge more than one iPad in succession...I would doubt it, but I cannot supply that information with any veracity.This Sabrent is a powerhouse, that's for sure.  Other than the really crummy USB cable, the only other down side might be its weight: it feels dense and is heavier than it looks...it is about 2  x 6 inches, and no thicker than about  inch, yet it IS weighty. However, it is a life-saver for the person who finds him or herself without a charged electrical device, and can not only fully charge items like cellphones, tablets, Kindles...anything that can be connected by a mini-USB cable, but it can also allow you to speak on or otherwise use the item WHILE it is charging. (Obviously, such use will slow down the charging speed.)It can itself be charged from a computer, or from any device hooked up to standard current that has an output port that takes a standard (female) USB.It is a sleek device: like its younger sister the Sabrent 6100 mAh (model # PB-BCBG), the 120000 is stylish and glossy and looks very polished and high tech. When it is charging it has blue lights that indicate its remaining capacity, and the blue-on-black is very appealing.I can say this for Sabrents, as well. I unintentionally dropped its companion (the 6100 mAh model) on both wood and concrete floors  over period of just a few days and nary a mark was on it (though I did have to snap the upper and lower sides of the unit together after they separated a few millimeters. There was, remarkably, no damage done.I will tell you this, too: I did not know how helpful and essential these devices would come in my life until I began carrying them, and since then I have run into many times where I, my wife, my daughters, or others needed a charge. I think this is today's modern equivalent to the sink garbage disposer, or the ice-maker in the freezer or, heck, smartphones and tablets: you could get by before you ever used one, but once you do you will not be able to remember how you got by without them.One final note: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Security Blanket for Almost All Your Battery Needs", "unixReviewTime": 1387065600, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2013"}

Two people with cell phones, headsets, a GPS, and who knows what else. So a 3-port car charger seems like a great idea.=== The Good Stuff ===* It was able to charge my iPad3, which is always my ultimate stress test for USB chargers. It was even able to charge my iPhone at the same time.* The iPad (high current) output has a black interior to the connector, so it is very easy to find, even in my Jeep where the cigarette lighter connectors are somewhat recessed.  The connectors are also labeled with small type, but if you remember that the black one is the high current, and the Android is at the bottom, you are good to go without ever trying to read the little type.* The &#34;nose&#34; fits far enough into the lighter so that it tends to stay well connected. My Jeep is 12 years old, so the lighter sockets are fairly well worn, but the springs on this adapter are snug enough to keep it in place.* There is no LED light. Feeling on this may vary, but I am all for stamping out annoying little &#34;status&#34; LED light pollution.= The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* Not really a negative of this particular device, but 3 cables can begin to get cluttered and tangled. Not a great thing to deal with at 70 mph on the freeway.* While the unit &#34;flares&#34; out a bit where the connectors are, plugging or unplugging the middle connector (with two other ones installed) is a bit of a trick. Most likely you will need to pull the whole assembly out of the lighter jack and then deal with it. Again, not a great idea at highway speeds.=== Summary ===It is a well designed and thought out little product. I have used it since the day I got it, and really appreciate the extra connectors in my vehicle since it means that I can leave cables connected even when I don't use them.Disclaimer: I received this unit as an evaluation sample direct from the manufacturer.

Bolse boasts that their 27 watt/5.4 amp output is the most powerful USB car charger on the market, and I&#8217;ve found no evidence to the contrary.All ports are listed as &#8220;universal&#8221; with the following notations: Port 1 (1.5 amps) is meant for Apple devices, Port 2 (1.5 amps) for Android devices, and Port 3 (2.4 amps) is designed to take on tablets. There are two LED lights that inform the user as to whether the charger&#8217;s cords are properly connected. (Cords are not included; but in my experience that is standard.)It can fit in the palm of your hand, and therefore can easily be stored in a glove compartment or console.I&#8217;m extremely impressed with the &#8220;look&#8221; of the Bolse charger; frequently chargers are boxy and square. Such is not the case with this charger&#8230;it has a very classy white casing, and any 90-degree edges are encased in shiny aluminum.

It only sticks out of your car's charging outlet about 1 inch.&#9830; Has three ports for a total of 5.4A output (a 2.4A Tablet port, a 1.5A Apple port and a 1.5A Android port).&#9830; Fast charging speeds for charging two devices concurrently, including an iPad.&#9830; Very compact for travel if you need to take a car charger with you on trips (renting a car at your destination for example).Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in tiny cardboard box with only a small sticker on it, no wasted packaging here.  Inside the box was the charger and a small instruction manual.  You see right away that this charger is surprisingly small for such a powerful 3-Port charger. It is the smallest one I've seen with these kind of specs.  It has three USB ports on the front, a 2.4A Tablet port, a 1.5A Apple port and a 1.5A Android port for a total of 5.4A output. It appears to have a very nice build quality.&#9830; Installation - As with any car charger, you basically just plug the unit into you car's charging outlet. Once plugged in, I noticed that the spring pushed back a little, but not enough to make it fall it.  Once in, the fit was pretty snug and secure.  No problems.  This charger makes most other 3-Port chargers look giant. My Pathfinder's charging outlets are on the side of the passenger area where a knee can easily bump the charger. This much smaller charger gives the passenger a little more leg room in my vehicle.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once installed, I did some basic tests to see how the Bolse car charger handles various charging situations. During my work commute, I took my iPhone 5 that had 48% charge remaining and I did a stand alone test using all ports for 5 minutes each.  The results are as follows:In the 2.4A Tablet port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 53%, or +5%.In the 1.5A Apple port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 58%, or +5%.In the 1.5A Android port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 63%, or +5%.Back in the 1.5A Apple port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 68%, or +5%.All ports worked great with my iPhone 5 and increased the charge on my phone by 1% per minute, which is right on par with most other chargers that I have tested.  I then plugged in my iPad 2 in the 2.4A Tablet port and it charged up just fine with my iPhone still in the 1.5A Apple port.  Individual and simultaneous charging tests were great.  I also plugged in my Bluetooth Music Receiver into the third port just for good measure with no problems.  For my situation, this was great with having several devices in my car on a regular basis.Conclusion:Overall, this is an amazing 3-Port Car Charger with really high power and great charging results.  It is really tiny and works great for multiple device vehicles.  At the time of this review, the price was $12.99 which really can't be beat with these kind of specs.

Overall the body is a tiny two inches long and the oval portion that houses the three USB ports is a mere one and half inches across. After inserting in your lighter receptacle it protrudes an inch and a quarter. So a big plus to Bolse for designing a multi-port charger in a form factor that will fit even the most cramped space.The ports are sufficiently spaced to allow me to insert three very heavy-duty USB connectors with wiggle room to spare (albeit, not much). I use these cables to test multi-port chargers and hubs because in many cases they are too large to fit tightly spaced adjacent ports. Surprisingly all three fit into the charger.At first I was peeved that this charger did not provide access to an internal fuse (the body is solid). Upon reflection I am not sure that is an important feature on modern charging systems. I cannot recall the last time I actually replaced a fuse in a charger, but I have vivid memories of cheaply made ones coming loose at the threaded section that housed fuses. I think I like this design better than the old style. A further advantage is I spend a lot of time on the Atlantic coast and the salt air rapidly deteriorates electrical and electronic gear. For my locale this sealed unit is perfect and will assure a longer service life.This tested perfectly in my 2008 Mazda 3's charger socket, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with GPS active, an iPad and iPhone 4S. All three devices simultaneously charged at the same rate thy did when plugged individually into my old single-port charger. That test validates the claims made in the product description. However, do heed  Martin A Hogan's very helpful December 9, 2013 review regarding car lighter socket output.

What is very interesting, though, is that all three can deliver full power simultaneously. (I would only do this for very long if the car engine is running, as you're drawing 27 watts plus losses. Not recommended for overnight use unless you want to really drain the battery.)This means you can charge three different items at once at a good rate of charge, for instance a tablet and two cell phones.

The plastic on the housing of this one looks pretty solid. I think it will last with normal care.

In addition, I would say that most households also have at least two cell phones (if not more), and maybe an e-Reader. And if anyone knows the joy of traveling long distances with children, you know that it is of the utmost importance to keep them occupied and their toys charged so that they won't resort to &#34;MOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooom, Brian's touching me!&#34; every five minutes. The complication is that vehicles tend to only have one cigarette lighter/port, meaning that you can only have one thing charging at a time.That is where the Bolse 3-Port USB Car Charger comes in. The idea for it is so simple: why only have one USB charging port when you can have three?ConstructionThe Bolse High Output 3-Port USB Car Charger (henceforth abbreviated as B3PCC) is sleek, simple, and feels durable. I used it successfully in the two cars of my household: a 2008 Dodge Caliber ST and a 2007 Chevy Silverado. In both instances I was able to push the charger so that the back of the USB port housing was flush against the dash. The three USB ports were easy to access and they accommodated each USB device that I attempted to charge.The B3PCC is designed to offer different amperages through the ports. From top to bottom:Port 1: 2.4A (Tablet)Port 2: 1.5A (Apple)Port 3: 1.5A (Android)While you will get the best performance results by using the port that is optimal for your device, you can still use any port on the charger without fear of damaging your gadget. As indicated in the product description, this charger will stop itself when it detects that the battery is full, so no worries! And, as an additional perk, the ports are easy to identify: the first port has a black outlet stop (the part that prevents the plug from going too far into the port), and the bottom two have white stops. When you&#8217;re driving and cannot take the time to read the port labeling (it is rather small text), this is indispensable.PerformanceTo keep this short and sweet, the B3PCC is WONDERFUL! I obtained the best results when I went on a trip across the state to take care of some appointments. While only a three-hour drive, the flexibility of being able to charge both my boyfriend&#8217;s cell phone and mine, as well as my Kindle Fire HD, at the same time was liberating. No more jockeying for who can charge their device first, or remembering to switch out one device for another. All three devices hooked up, and the best part, all charged VERY quickly!I also tested out my iPod Touch (4th gen) with the Apple port; I like to plug my iPod into my stereo on long trips and being able to keep it fully charged so that it will work for the entire trip is important. I just plugged it in and left it there the entire day. With the auto shutoff feature to prevent overcharging the battery I was able to safely keep my iPod charged and had excellent music for the duration of my trip!OverallThis item is a must-have. It is simple in design but big in use. If you have multiple devices that require charging and you know that you will be on a long car trip, the Bolse 3-Port USB Car Charger is a must-have. It has room for three devices, is easy to operate, and will actively protect your battery by cutting itself off when it detects that the gadget is at a full charge. Keep your entire family happy and charged up and purchase this charger; I guarantee that you will wonder how you ever lived without it!**Disclaimer: This charger was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

Before using a Bluetooth speaker, I would just listen through the speakers on my phone and try and set my phone close enough to the shower I could hear it, but far enough away it wouldn't get splashed with water.Now it's not an issue. I can pair my phone with this shower speaker and not worry about keeping my iPhone close enough to me that it might get damp. I can set my phone on my towel shelf in the bathroom, several feet away from the sink and the shower.

It has many advantages that I list below.PROS:1) Pairing/Connecting - Once I pressed the correct function from the multi-purpose Power Button, it did pair with my tablet and my Android phone just fine.*Helpful hint: Be sure to turn on your Android device's Bluetooth FIRST before you attempt to pair/connect it with this Bluetooth Speaker. Then turn on the Bluetooth speaker and let your phone or tablet search for devices. This makes it so much easier to pair/connect. Once it is paired for the first time, the next time connecting is so easy!2) Sound Quality / LoudnessLOUDNESS - For a smaller speaker, in the shower even with the water on full force, the sound is VERY LOUD (can be turned down).*Helpful hint for you about loudness: First, if you plan on listening to songs from your Playlist from your phone on this, adjust the phone's sound FIRST to your liking and louder than you think because you will need it kind of loud in the shower. Also you can turn the volume UP OR DOWN on the Bluetooth speaker by using the top or bottom (on the left side)buttons.SOUND QUALITY on this speaker:The sound quality is very good to excellent for such a small unit. So I compared this to a larger Bluetooth Speaker that I own and use (that is not waterproof one like this one is) that I have and the sound was very, very close in sound quality and loudness. The overall Treble is quite good and for me, the Bass is pretty good as well. This is a huge plus for this Bluetooth speaker!3) FM Radio - Since I live on top of a hill and near a mountain and lots of trees, usually I cannot get FM that well in Bluetooth types of devices/radios. However, this one was able to CLEARLY pickup two of my favorite stations loud and clear and they stayed on while in the shower.CONS:1) The device's Power On has many multi-purposes on it. Personally, I would have preferred to see a dedicated BLUETOOTH ON/OFF button and also a POWER ON/OFF Button. As it is now this ONE BUTTON does all of these:--Turns on the device--Turns on Bluetooth.--Turns off Bluetooth--Turn on the FM Radio.--Serves as a charging indicator (when you turn it off and then plug in the USB cable, then the light changes to a NON BLINKING RED. This unit took some patience on my part because of the Power Button doing too many things at once, but I was able to get it working fine and this is just a very minor thing really for me personally.Overall, I like this speaker OK, it is loud and clear, but there are two things I really DO NOT LIKE AT ALL:1) The charger that came with this is propriety, and should I misplace or lose this, I cannot charge this speaker.2) The unit is really too loud in my opinion.

Lebryk", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "For not a lot of money, this funny waterproof Bluetooth speaker delivers pretty good sound. Just don't lose that USB charging cable - it is a unique cable and you don't have one laying around the house.The sound is reasonably good. There is some bass - you shouldn't expect to thump in the shower. Highs are well controlled and work well to fairly light volume. Frankly, this speaker surprised me.This is a three trick pony: simple Bluetooth playing from a compatible device - iPhone / iPad works great, FM radio, and speakerphone (yeah exactly what I want to do, talk to somebody while I'm naked in the shower - that just seems all wrong - fortunately it isn't a four trick pony with added camera). Bluetooth is fairly straightforward - press the power button and the unit starts in pairing mode. Turn on your device, look for BTS-19 in the Bluetooth control panel, select that device, and after a few seconds the two will pair. When you press the track forward or backward button music will play. This is where things get weird - quickly press either button to advance tracks, hold down the upper button to decrease volume and hold down the lower button to increase volume. This is tricky to master, but eventually you'll get the hang of it.If you get a phone call the music will mute, the phone will ring, to answer the call press the phone button on the right side. Be ready, they will hear the shower and anything else you're doing in there. Enjoy talking to people naked and wet.The last function is a weird little bonus - FM radio. If you tap the power button once, the speaker will change to FM radio. When you press the track forward or backward the radio station changes. There's no way to tell what station you've dialed in, it just goes to the next strong station with every press. The reception was surprisingly good. Quick press the power button to return to Bluetooth.To turn off the speaker you have to hold down the power button for a good five or six seconds. The little LED will turn white / purple.The charge port is on the rear and covered by a rubber flap. The charger is via USB but the business end is a round jack that looks like a small laptop charger connector. If you lose the cable, you'll have to go to Radio Shack and buy a universal AC adapter - dial it to 5V and find a tip that fits. Honestly, this is the single worst design feature of a really good product.Curiosity got me - I had to see if this speaker can be taken apart. Turns out it was pretty easy to get inside - the rubber shoulders remove easily and the case is held together with four screws. The construction is quite good. There is an O-Ring that seals out water from between the two halves. The speaker has a rubber cone, so it can take a lot of water and still work. I recognized the electronics from the little barrel speakers, this is a good thing. There is a big beefy battery. The antenna are really long and wrap all the way around inside the speaker - that is why the FM reception is so good.The price is right, the sound good, and you get good tunes in the shower, or other wet area.I was provided a review sample.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1404518400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2014"}

Inside the box was the speaker, a proprietary USB charging cable and an instruction manual.  The speaker looks good and had a nice pink color.  It has rubberized buttons and a rubber cover that closes off the charging port.  On the front, it has various buttons that have a play/pause button, two combined FF/RW and volume buttons, a power button and a speakerphone button with microphone.  The hanging hook moved from side to side and rotated to give multiple hanging options.  It looks like it is built well.&#9830; Use and Performance - I plugged in the included USB charging cable into the unit and into my computer to give it an initial charge before testing it out.  Once the speaker was charged, I easily paired it to my iPhone 5S a did a variety of tests to try it out.Test #1 (Sound Quality Test) - At my desk, I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to Michael Bubl&eacute; to Excision Bass Heavy Dubstep (the Destroid album), and the speaker performed great.  It reached pretty high volumes while still maintaining good clarity.  It sounded really good overall for a single speaker setup that is focused on being a shower speaker, not a HiFi speaker.Test #2 (Shower Test) - I then tried it out in the shower.  I started playing a playlist on my phone and left it on the counter about six feet away from the shower.  You have to get the music going on your device first because you can only really do pause/play and skip songs backwards and forwards.  Best bet is to use a playlist or shuffle several songs. In the shower, the sound was really good.  It got very loud at times, so much so, that I had to turn it down by holding down the RW button (which controls volume also).  The controls were great for moving between songs and adjusting the volume.  During my shower, I hung the speaker in various locations on the shower caddy facing forward and sideways and over the shower head pipe.  I then had my wife take my phone out of the bathroom and walk it across the house.  It stayed connected until it got pretty far from the bathroom, at least a 15 foot range through a few walls.  Plenty of range if you want to leave your phone outside of the bathroom and away from all that humidity.  I also tried out Siri by pressing the phone button, which worked pretty well, but not really something I would do much due to the shower noise.Conclusion:Overall, this was a nice shower speaker.  It sounded great and had nice controls.  It has a lot of hanging options and works well in my initial test.  I also tested out the Abco Suction Cup Model Shower Speaker and bought a second one as a gift.  Both types of speaker work great.  If you are looking for a fun shower speaker that sounds good and works well, this one is a great choice.

It has an IPX4 rating.&#9654;&#65038; IPX stands for Ingress Protection Rating or International Protection Rating, a code published by the International Electrotechnical Commission.  It classifies the protection a device provides against things like dust, water, and accidental contact. IPX4 means that  water splashing against the outside will have no harmful effect.  To achieve an IPX4 rating a device is tested for 5 minutes with a water volume of 10 liters per minute under 80-100 kPa pressure.The speaker comes with both an AC wall adapter and a USB cable.  The jack inlet is located on the back of the unit under a waterproof seal.  A full charge takes 3-4 hours when using the AC wall adapter.  A single charge provides 7-8 hours of listening time.Pairing the unit with your device is easy.  Turn on Bluetooth on the device that you wish to use, then press the Power button on the right front of the speaker until you get a pink light (on) and then continue to hold another five seconds until you see alternating red and blue, indicating that the device is in pairing mode.

Along those lines...- There's no manual. I'm not an electrical genius and the makers of the device need to be more explicit about what these numbers mean: what devices can be charged by what ports? I believe I'm no different from most people with devices nowadays...we don't mind learning, but don't just throw numbers at us and expect us to understand it all.- No feature for auto shutoff when item is fully charged.- Two outlets did not work with my Kindle, but did with my smartphones: the right-hand 800mA, and the 1500mA.- The ports, and their interiors, seemed to wobble a little over time...like the device was no longer as tight as it was when I first got it.All in all, this is a good device that could use some tweaking. It has the right idea: centralize a multi-port charging station, and make it work with as many devices as it can, simultaneously. Though the device does desperately need a manual or a cheat sheet to specify JUST HOW THOSE PORTS ARE TO BE USED.Still, for the price this unit is being offered for is indeed a bargain, one that should make many people overlook those flaws in favor of the benefits it offers.NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Functional, and at a Great Price...But Needs a Manual!", "unixReviewTime": 1387065600, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2013"}

I&#8217;ve had the 6-port charger for several months now, and I use it daily.  I&#8217;ve found only one short-coming with the 6-port:  Too few 2A slots.  So, I still needed a few more chargers.  What I end up with, then, are enough 2A slots and too many 1A and lower slots.Enter this new-for-2014 model with 3 slots.  Perfect!  In my mind, the best &#8220;family&#8221; set-up is two or more of the 3-slot models, set around the house in convenient locations.On both the 3- and 6-port chargers, I really love the fact that they have thick, pliable, 6 foot cords. I had been looking for chargers like this: I can plug these chargers into a low wall outlet and still sit it on the corner of my desk--any corner of my desk. You can set it on top of a four-drawer file cabinet and still have some cord distance with which to work. You can set it on a hall table or other convenient-to-you locations (as opposed to a convenient-to-the-charger location).  And when I say pliable, I mean pliable: The rubber is tough, but gives up its memory rather quickly.Does it work? It works for our AT&T; Unite cards, our phones, our old phone, blue tooth speakers, and our tablets. My Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 can take more than this charger can give it, so I give it exactly what it wants and plug it into the surge protector separately.The 3-port charger has a nice neat look to it:  It is definitely compact at 4&#8221; (including the unbending part of the cord) x 2 5/8&#8221; x 1&#8221; (including the on/off toggle switch).

This means charging a tablet, two typical smartphones, and an auxiliary device can be done all at the same time without extending charging times. Some other units won't deliver full power; this one does.2. All the ports face out (or up, depending where you plug it in). This is SO convenient. The ports are easily accessible and there is no problem inserting the USB plugs.3. The AC power prongs fold in for transport instead of sticking out when not in use.4. The unit is slim (see the product photos) and takes up just ONE outlet position or ONE position on a power strip. No worries about putting it at the end of the power strip, covering up two outlets, or anything like that.5. The unit is lightweight and made of sturdy plastic.

Let's be up front here, this product has but one thing going for it - price.  Currently it' s 11, even though OXA is shipping another product of the same capacity for a buck less.  The difference?  The other one has a keychain and no buttons.  Frankly, if it were me, I'd get the other one.  But let's look at this one, just because.  Metallic outer cover with a cheap plastic button and an LED hidden under another plastic cover.  What's the button for?  You have to press the button to turn the power on to your device.  Further, if you accidentally hit the button, because it's in your pocket, purse, or something, the LED comes on.  But guess what - it doesn't turn off until you press the button again.  This can lead to the battery getting drained, making the unit a useless weight.  That's just plain silly.  If it must use a button, then it should have an automatic off feature when it's not being used.  Better yet, ditch the button entirely and let the thing figure out when there is power draw or not like so many other products of this type do.  (Is it a surprise the other model I mentioned does that?).  The output is a bit disappointing.  First, it's supposed to be 1A.  The sticker on the bottom states it's 800mA, or, 0.800A.  So, which is it really?  Even at the 1A specification, 2A would be better.  Many new tablets, phones, and other devices use 2A input power, and the extra boosts how fast a device can charge.  Of the stack of external batteries I have, this OXA charges devices the slowest and depletes quickly compared to similar capacity units.  This causes me to question just how efficient the unit is, as it should give the same amount of charge.  I noted other reviewers state that their units broke down after a few uses, which doesn't surprise me.  I've had this one since March, used it quite a few times for testing, and it's still going strong.  This alone is the reason I rate it as an \"Ok\" product, that it actually works.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A little bit of power", "unixReviewTime": 1405814400, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2014"}

It is not too heavy at 2.5 ounces and a little bigger than a lipstick case. The other way to get this double-your-charge power is to buy a combo phone case/charger. Most of those give you about 2400mAh. This little power bank gives you a little extra umph at 2600mAh. Plus, I believe you will find this little baby to be less expensive than the difference between a phone case and a phone case with attached battery.It is a matter of choosing to add a bit of bulk and weight to your phone itself, or with this, search for it when you need it at the bottom of your bag or backpack.

I also think it has enough &#34;edges&#34; to it to quickly wear out your pocket lining.My observations after experimenting with this mini &#34;juice box&#34;:--The enclosed USB cable is short: 12&#34;.--It has one IN, one OUT port, which I think is more than adequate.--It does not have a flashlight feature.--The IN/OUT ports are 5V, which is good.--There is no LED gauge showing how much charge you have left.--The ON/Off switch is raised off the surface of the box.While I like this little &#34;juice&#34; box, (it does perform by charging quickly and providing 2X power), I don't love it. Why? Because I found that the raised ON/OFF button is too easy to &#34;bump&#34; on while sitting at the bottom of my bag. As a matter of fact, the button turned itself on during shipping!Personally, maybe because my fingers are long, I don't mind--and prefer--a phone case/ battery charger combo. I don't mind the tad bit of extra bulk and weight in my hand as I hold my phone.

I will provide my take on this battery and some of the reasons why I rated it so highly.There are two trends happening in the portable battery market: (1) high capacity for power users and (2) smaller, low capacity models for when you are low on charge and need a convenient and portable battery pack. This is the latter and at around ten bucks is a bargain if you are using one of the more power hungry phones like the iPhone 5S.In fact, at 2600mAh, this will add about 150% to the use time of an Apple iPhone 5S, which comes in at 1560mAh. On the other hand it will probably not add more than two extra hours to an Apple iPad 2's internal 6930mAh battery. I am basing my estimates on worst case scenarios where there is power loss from temperature changes, repeated battery use and other factors. Out of the box in a stable environment this battery should perform much better than my conservative estimates.Think of it as an emergency source that will easily fit in a purse or pocket. In that context even a tablet user will find that it can add just enough juice to make a difference for a critical task.My reasons for awarding this five stars are:- price versus value: at the time of this review this pack was hovering in the ten to twelve buck range, which is the price of two fast food lunches. Considering that it does provide a lot of use time to some of the power hungry phones on the market it's definitely functional. Do not forget that this is perfect for cameras and other devices, so it's handy on vacations, hiking and beaches.- solid construction: it's practically indestructible, with no real moving parts (although the input and output ports are exposed).- charging cable  has removable ends and includes mini and micro USB ends, plus an Apple 30 pin connector for all but Apple's newest phones. It also provides a mini barrel connector end for other devices like a bluetooth speaker I own. It's an all-in-one solution as long as you are not expecting the newer Apple Lightning cable.- size: it's fits purses and pockets as I mentioned, and is a functional keychain as well. True, the battery is a oblong block, but the size does make it easy to find misplaced keys.I am thoroughly pleased with mine for the reasons stated.

It's small and lightweight and will go easily in a briefcase, purse, or even a reasonable sized pocket. OXA did a really good job of providing a variety of cables and adapters so the unit will work with your device without you having to go buy something. For the price, this is just amazing. Most companies let you fend for yourself for the most part.What are the use cases? Keep in mind that this is a small power supply. At 2600mAh and allowing for losses, it's not going to give a full charge to your tablet. It might give a full charge to your smartphone, depending on the battery size. What it will do, though, is &#34;top up&#34; your smartphone or give a boost to your tablet, when AC power isn't readily available, and it can do this right in your pocket or briefcase while you do something else. This is especially useful if you've got a smartphone that doesn't allow the battery to be replaced and the 2nd battery strategy isn't an option.I found that the unit gave three &#34;top ups&#34; to my old Droid X phone (which I had run down to about 65% battery capacity each time). That's equivalent to perhaps one full charge. I maybe would have expected a little more, but all in all it's probably about right. Again, remember, this is a small, lightweight, and highly portable unit. Don't expect it to do more than it's designed to do. &#34;Top up&#34; time with the unit's 1 amp output was less than an hour.Charging time is a little over three hours on a 1-amp circuit, again, just about what you'd expect at a rough 80% efficiency.I would ordinarily recommend a unit with a little more capacity so it would be able to charge a tablet a little more effectively. However, there would be a cost, weight, and portability trade-off.

Let me explain.This mini power supply has a 2600 mAh capacity, puts out the usual 5 volts but only at 800mAh. First let me explain my use of the word \"seems\" in the paragraph above this one. Because I don't have a proper battery tester (the ones that accurately test capacity are in the $300 range), I can only give anecdotal testimony about the power output and capacity of a battery. Because I have an extensive collection of devices and a variety of batteries for my devices, I have a pretty good idea what \"x\" amount of capacity and \"y\" amount of amps output are. My best guess is that this OXA power supply meets or possibly exceeds the claimed power output by a small measure.Now, why do I say this power supply isn't ideal for every application? The answer is that many larger and high end devices consume much more energy than what this OXA product can supply. Two examples are my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and my wife's Kindle Fire. My Note 2 ships with a 2 amp charger and even that is barely enough to charge the battery if I'm using the phone as a GPS with the screen on full brightness. This OXA would certainly extend my usage time, but my phone would continue to discharge even while plugged into the charger. I did leave the phone connected to the power supply overnight with the screen off, and it did raise my battery level from 32% to 56% by morning, but my phone has a massive 9300 mAh battery, which explains why the power supply didn't charge it much.I plugged my iPod Touch 4th Generation into the OXA power supply and it took it from 8% to fully charged, while I was listening to the iPod over the course of a 5 hour drive. At the end of the trip, my iPod was fully charged and the power supply still had some juice left. The reason for this is that the iPod has a much smaller battery and consumes a fraction of the energy my phone burns through.So before buying this OXA mini power supply, think about if it will do what you need it to do. OXA sells a wide array of larger power supplies, and of course there are other manufacturers out there as well. I'm satisfied that this charger does what it claims, and it is priced lower ($10.99 at time of review) than competing models in the same size and power output classes. For me personally, because of my energy hungry devices, I probably would want a more powerful supply. If you're looking to charge an iPod or more energy efficient phone, then this model is one you might want to consider.I didn't pay for my test sample, but had I bought this for $11 here on Amazon, I'd be happy with the value I received.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not OXA's Best Work, But not Bad", "unixReviewTime": 1392940800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2014"}

OXA has tried to pack a bit more into this battery pack by offering up a TF reader, something I&#8217;ve only seen in one other battery pack. A bit extraneous for most people, but it does work and is a nice bonus.There are three USB connectors included with the package, including a Lightning connector. I couldn&#8217;t get the 30-pin connector to work with my first generation iPad. Admittedly, it&#8217;s fickle, but if it doesn&#8217;t work, there&#8217;s no port for using your own cables. The Lightning connector immediately connected and worked on boosting my iPad Air&#8217;s charge.Speaking of iPads, if you are looking at this small capacity OXA, you may wish to take a pass and head on up to something with at least 10000mAh. For example, some of the iPads can be power hogs and the iPad Air has a capacity of 8820mAh. If you&#8217;re looking at the OXA for your iPhone, you&#8217;ll do well and get a full charge.

You are good to go without any extra paraphernalia. I love the looks of this battery! I've always appreciated the shape and size of this type of charger: It fits in your purse, in a pocket, just about anywhere; they don't come any smaller than this for an 2200mAh. So, it is specialized--and there is nothing wrong with that.But if you are going to have to add an adapter onto the micro plug, you will lose the intent of this design; you will negate the efficiency and the compactness that this design provides by having to drag around the adapter--because there is no hide-y-hole for it. If you have to cart around a USB cable and adapter, you'd be better off checking out the OXA Perfume 2600mAh SAFE External Battery 18M WTY Premium Samsung Cells Key Chain charger external portable power supply (Check Amp for tablets) for Smartphones and other electronic devices that has the same shape and size and a little heavier because of the extra battery power). Plus it has a slot for an SD card.Back to this 2200 mAh power bank with the nifty aluminum siding: I like that the cover/cap comes off and reveals the USB port inside. I like the added touch of a slot for the SD card (also under the cap). I also like that you cannot lose the cover: The carry cord is strung through it, so when you lift off the cover it hangs on the cord. It does not have any sharp edges to wear a hole through pants pockets or the bottom of a cloth-lined bag. It is well-balanced and seems really light weight, too, at only 2.8 ounces.

A trio of blue LEDs indicates charge/discharge and remaining capacity, and holding the power button turns on a small white-LED flashlight.A very short captive USB cable is used for discharge (charging a load), but the unit has to be plugged into a USB outlet (as if it were a huge USB thumb drive) for charging. That's painfully inconvenient if your chargers are below the desk or at the wall (you can't plug a USB cable into this powerbank).On charge/discharge, the cylinder gets warm to the touch. However, I noticed my phone reported \"charged\", but was still charging from this powerbank. I worry that means it doesn't have an auto-shutoff (overcharging can damage the battery being charged). I haven't observed this behavior with other powerbanks (Oxa and other brands). 2200mAh is enough to charge up smaller phone batteries, but typically the entire powerbank's capacity can't be discharged. So this unit will, at most, top-off modern phones like my Nexus5 (which has a stock 2300mAh battery).There's a microSHDC card-reader slot to turn this unit into a thumb-drive, but no onboard flash memory.Considering how important mobile devices are to modern living, I really like having a powerbank in every bag I use (laptop case, camera bag, airline carry-on, etc). This one is compact enough to fit \"anywhere\", but its design is quite limiting. The barrel shape is convenient to hold, and I like the integrated flashlight and captive discharge cable.

At 2200 mAh, it's hardly a powerhouse, but its small size and light weight are a satisfactory tradeoff. The charger will give more or less a single charge to many phones, a 2/3 or so charge to larger phones, and maybe 1/3 charge to a tablet. It's really best used with phones.It's clever. A micro-USB cable is integral and folds into a recess in the unit's body. That necessarily means that the cord is very short, maybe two inches, but it's still usable. Charging begins with pressing a button. The same button also shows state of charge when the unit isn't in use (little LEDs give an approximate idea), and turn on the flashlight  feature (see below).The cap of the unit pops off to expose a USB plug, which is how you recharge the unit itself (plugging into a USB charger). There is a TF card reader, which I wasn't able to test with my setups, but it could conceivably be useful in some circumstances. Finally, there is a tiny flashlight which won't light your way along the beach but will help you do things like put your car key into the car door on a dark night.Charge-up time is about what you'd expect, something over an hour on a 2 amp USB charger. Charging times for your phone or other device are also pretty much as expected; a half-charge top-up on an iPhone took something less than an hour and a half.So far so good. The unit is supplied with a couple of adapters for phones (like iPhone) that don't use micro-USB. Of course, this affects portability a little (you need to carry the adapter too).The one issue? Please carefully read the list of supported devices before you buy this. It would not work on my old Droid phone. I contacted OXA and they politely pointed out that Droid is not in the list of supported devices. Fair enough, but don't buy this blind; take a few seconds to check.Four stars overall. It doesn't make five because it isn't universally usable and it doesn't pack a lot of power.

That was the first indication this was not a normal little speaker. The sound just vibrated my hand and sounded like a much larger speaker. After putting it on the table it made a few more sounds and went right into the pairing mode and my phone connected right to it.Of course the first thing I did was find a song and crank it up until the family yells,\"Turn that thing down!\" two rooms away. Nice! Since it is made for phones and has a mic in it as well, I then called my unsuspecting spouse who said it sounded fine on the other end, but on my end it sounded great. Nice full bass tones and much preferred over the phone's speaker phone.The practical side of me then kicked as I thought what I would really use it for. If I had to do a long conference call I would use the MOSOUND in a heart beat. The sound would be very easy on the ears and would free me up to do other things, like shop Amazon, during those long pointless calls we all get sucked into. I think it would easily pick up my, \"uh huh\" and \"yes, of course I am listening.\"We connected both a Galaxy 3 and my iPhone to it with no problem.On a day to day basis though it will not see much phone time. I have better plans. Anyone with an iPad knows the speakers are less than amazing, pretty much useless.  To hear anything in a noisy environment you either need to use head phones, which mess my hair, ear buds that just bother me or cup your hand just right under the speaker to shoots the sound forward. The MOOUND has transformed my iPad to a great multimedia machine with out having to do any of the fore mentioned. I like laying in on a table next to me so it is aimed at my ear and I get great sound while no one else really hears much.In the car, it fits nicely in the cup holder that actually boosts the bass nicely and I don't have to mess around plugging the phone into the car radio.Comparing it to other wireless speakers I have to say price and size-wise it is a great deal.

Lerch", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "For a quick review, if you are looking to add a BT speaker to your phone (I paired it w/ a Lumia 1020 and iPhone 5S), the sound from this little, light, easy to carry speaker is pretty spectacular.The one limitation I find slightly annoying, and part of the reason for a drop from 5 stars to 4.5/4.75 (still ranked it as 5), is that you can't control volume from the speaker itself - not a huge deal since I just carry my phone anyway. You can control the previous/next track capability from the speaker though, and using it as a speaker phone worked really well also.If you plan to connect this to your Windows 8.1 or Windows 8 computer, I would recommend against it. The sound is anemic for some reason with no apparent way to correct it, other than using software with an equalizer, and even then for some reason it never sounds as good as just pairing to a phone. Very odd.My longer review:Pairing the device is bang on simple. The first time you power it on, it is in pairing mode. Set your device to pair and it should locate and connect to it. If you have already paired the device, simply power the speaker off if it isn't already, then press and hold the power button for a few seconds until the blue light on the speaker flashes red/blue indicating it is in pairing mode.The sound quality, for the size and price, is phenomenal. An audiophile will never be satisfied with this speaker, but as an audiophile that can allow for and cope with the limitations of portable audio, this is actually one of the best sounding mini-BT speakers I've had the pleasure to use. As long as it is paired to a phone and not a Windows PC.I tried an amalgamation of music, from Death Metal, Thrash Metal, Japanese Pop, Rock, Pop and classical to test. Classical music, with the subtle nuances involved in the performances, suffers a little but still sounds acceptable.

I discover that, with the unsurprising exception of the iPad, I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours.

I was only able to charge my iPad to 62% of its full charge, but considering iPad's size this is still really impressive.To fully charge this battery it takes about five hours. This is much longer than some other such batteries that I have tested, and I think this is primarily due to the fact that it relies on USB connection for powering.

Chambers", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I found some good things to like about the LiBa 5600mah battery charger, and there were no negatives. It's ideal for someone who needs up to two complete recharges of their cellphone. It's not ideal for someone with a 9&#34; or 10&#34; inch tablet with 3G/4G connection who uses their tablet all day without access to an AC or vehicle charger. That's the tradeoff you get when the charger is small like the LiBa with only 5600mAh capacity. On the other hand, the small size and low weight (4.6 ounces) means it's very portable and hardly noticeable in a backpack or purse.I used the fully charged LiBa to recharge my smartphone, which has a 2200mAh battery. The smartphone was at 40% when I started, and it took 108 minutes to reach 100%. The LiBa still showed 3 LEDs, which meant it still had 50-75% charge. Doing some arithmetic, my phone required 2200 x 60% = about 1320mAh from the LiBa. That would leave the LiBa with about 5600 - 1320 = 4280mAh capacity, which is 76%. So the recharge used about a fourth of the LiBa's capacity, actually a little more if electrical losses in this kind of device are factored in.The output of the LiBa is rated at 5V~1.0A. That's fine for most mobile devices, although the 1A output will take longer to recharge devices that can take up to 2A. If the charging speed is an issue, the LiBa may not be the best charger for you, depending on the device you have.So for most cellphones, if your needs aren't too great, and portability is an issue, the LiBa 5600mAh battery charger would be a good choice. For most 7&#34; tablets, you should get one full charge from the LiBa.

It does have some heft, but has some nice features like a light bar that indicates remaining capacity and an integrated flashlight.When it comes to overall capacity this would have been a big deal this time last year, but is a bit anemic by today's standards. Of course, the price is far less than it would have been a year ago, so that's progress. Most of us need a little extra power from time to time, and this is all most of us need.When I evaluate batteries I take the rated capacity and multiply it by .9 to obtain a more realistic figure. Temperature changes, the age of the battery itself and losses during charging operations all eat away at the rated capacity, so calling this 5600mAh battery 5040mAh sets expectations to a more realistic level. It will still charge a power hungry iPhone 5S over 3.2 times of that device's normal 1560mAh capacity, which quadruples its use time. Yes, there are bigger batteries on the market, with correspondingly bigger form factors and price tags. For me this one is good enough.For tablet users, this is still not a bad deal when you consider that this will add about seven and a half hours to the 10.5 hours of use time a stock iPad 2 gets with its internal 6930mAh battery. Even my power hungry Samsung Tab 3 10.1 gets an extra 5 or so hours added to its seven hour use time from that tablet's internal 6800mAh battery.  The bottom line here is this may not be the biggest and baddest battery on the market, but for most of us it gets the job done.About the only possible issue with this battery is the slower charging rate. Its input and output ports are rated at 1 Amp, which will charge just about any device on the market, albeit more slowly than the fast charging models that are on the market. Plus, this has a single output port, compared to two or more on contemporary models. For single devices like a phone this is not an issue, and considering the small size and price tag it's a benefit.

It's relatively lightweight and compact--3 1/2 x1 3/4 x 3/4 inches. Unlike other chargers that use tiny dots as power indicators, this charger has brightly lit bars on top that are 1/4 x 1/16 inch, which makes them easily visible. Plus the bars continue for another 1/8 inch on the side with charging and output ports, so you can see the power level from different angles.3. This comes with a micro USB charging cable and two tips that can be used with that cable--mini USB and standard Apple. There is no carry pouch, so you need to be careful not to lose the tips.4. The 1A output works well to charge my iPhone 4S, though of course is not strong enough to charge an iPad.5. The flashlight is a single LED and is easy to use--two pushes of the power button on and two pushes off (the included directions mistakenly say to hold the power button down for three seconds.

Please see my not on testing methodology at the end of this review.Now for the interesting set of additional features:- Flashlight: Not overly bright and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  You'll probably only need it in pitch blackness and it's plenty bright for that.- SOS light:  I like this.  You press the button for a few seconds and it starts blinking SOS in Morse code until you turn it off.  Not super bright but certainly visible from a long way off in the dark.  Given the size of the battery, it will keep flashing for days.- The laser pointer:  Unlike the flashlight, this *is* quite bright.  In addition, unlike most low cost and &#34;afterthought&#34; laser pointers, this throws a beam that has a reasonably large spot that stands out.- Water &#34;proofness&#34;: It is, as long as you keep the rubber cover covering the USB ports.

I test these external batteries the way I (and expect most people) use them.  In particular, I don't go to any great lengths to make sure they are 100% full.  That involves a lot of time, varying charging rates, and an intimate knowledge of the particular battery.  Me, I connect the thing to a USB power source and wait until it indicates that it's full.  That's usually when the battery being tested indicates it's full (lights go on, off, stop flashing, or change color).To measure the battery capacity I see how long it can deliver a sustained current to a known load and still maintaining around five volts across it.

Have a look around Amazon and see how many different kinds of these external batteries there are.  A ton, and half of those are the same product with a different brand name on them.  So what make this one from OXA different?  Not much really, other than it has a solar set up on it.  But lets be 100% clear, the \"Can be charged via either directly via USB cable or from solar energy via highly efficient solar panel\" probably gives you the wrong impression of how it works.  Technically, this statement is correct - it can charge both ways.  But if you're thinking that the battery can go from zero to full in just a few hours under the sun, you would be incorrect.The panel may be highly efficient, but it's undersized for anything more than trickle charging in the short term.  It will take several days in the sun for this unit to fill its belly with power.  In my testing, over a 48hr period with clear sunny skies and low heat, the battery picked up a 25% charge at most.  That makes sense as the panel puts out 1.5W max under the best of conditions.  If I remember the math correctly and using the units specs, it should take about 16 days to completely fill the 8000mAh battery inside, under perfect conditions.  Longer if isn't optimal light, longer if the unit gets hot, longer because it's burning off power on the LED indicators that tell you the battery is charging, and so on.  Taking an educated guess, 20-25 days.Anyhow, the unit as a whole isn't so bad.  The manual sucks, as it does with just about every OXA product they have sent my way.  This is something that I know OXA is working on, but for now you have to go to their website for manuals that are far superior to those included with what you buy from them.  The solar panel is covered with a removable film to keep it from getting scratched up in shipping.  On mine, the film was tucked in under the frame, making the removal incomplete and a bit messy looking.  In the end, I took a jeweler's screwdriver to the it to remove first the frame and then the remaining film.Output from the unit was solid.  You can either take 2A in one go or split that 2A into two 1A by plugging in another device.  Using an oscilloscope with current clamp, I verified the power levels in both configurations.  Charge times were a couple hours each, after my typical 5x cycle of charge/discharge for new batteries.So yeah, it does work well enough as an external battery, and has decent capacity for its price range.  But, that solar business is a total let down and adds some limitations - you have to take more care of it else you'll smash the solar panel.  Myself, if I wanted an external battery with solar charging capability, I'd skip this OXA model and research some other models instead.

Unfortunately, the solar component just doesn't work -- more on that later.  If I charge the battery using an outlet, however, it's a fantastic external power bank, albeit larger (because of the solar panels) than the usual.The power bank has two out ports, one 1A and the other 2A, the last one critical for charging an iPad.  The 5V input uses a standard microUSB cable for charging.  I like that it has an on/off button for conserving a charge, although I can't figure out how to tell whether it is on or off unless I have a device attached.  It has four, blue LED lights that blink when it is charging, either by wall outlet of light.As for the solar, I've had the battery on my window sill for five straight days, and it can't even charge my iPad one percent of its total.  It transfers power to my iPad, using the 2A output, for less than 15 minutes.  I thought that maybe the solar cells are used not for storage (that is, not to charge the battery itself) but for transfer while it was in the sun.  Nope.  I checked with the company to confirm that I did not receive a defective solar cell, and they told me that the solar cells were for emergency only.  Unfortunately, my experience shows that solar energy cannot be used even in an emergency.  It doesn't store the charge, and it doesn't transfer it directly.  I don't understand the purpose of including solar cells on this otherwise good power pack.The type of people who will likely consider this external battery are those who camp, hike, or want to be able to charge devices during an extended power outage.

If you're a student and with Spring/Summer coming you want to work outside, but be able to charge your phone/iPad/tablet/whatever, this is brilliant. A friend of mine has a boat that has limited electric charging capability. Taking this battery along means you can still keep your devices charged. I need to try to figure out how long it takes to charge the battery from dead to full charge using just solar, but as of about 5 or 6 uses, it seems to be quite efficient. It takes longer to charge via solar than if you just plug it in and charge from the outlet, but the utility and convenience of the solar collector can't be dismissed.The battery itself is an 8000 mAh battery, meaning you can charge an iPhone 5S about 5 times on a full battery charge, or my Lumia 1020 can be charged 4 times. That's a lot of charging time. If you have an iPad Air, I believe the battery is a 12,000 mAh battery, so you would get 3/4 of a full charge from the OXA. Older iPads, such as the 2 I believe have a 6000 mAh battery, so you would get 1 full charge and a little bit from this battery.You have 4 blue lights to indicate how much charge is left on the battery. It's not as granular as the Maxboost Power Bank I have (the Maxboost has a display with percentages), but again, the utility of the solar charging just can't be overlooked.There is a 2 Amp charging port and a 1 Amp. The 2 Amp can be used for anything, though it is recommended it be used for devices that accept the higher standard, such as tablets. Some phones also can be used on this port without issues, so check your phone's manual. The safest charging port is the 1 A, which can still charge an iPad, albeit slowly.In reality, this power bank is just a power bank. There are other options with higher capacities at the MSRP on this one, but you don't buy this one for just capacity, you buy this one if you have a need to charge your devices using the power of solar. If you don't need solar, you may be better served with a smaller, easier to pocket, power bank.Highly recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome charger with solar charging options", "unixReviewTime": 1391299200, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2014"}

I've heard good things and bad things about case/charger combos.If you glance through my reviews, you'll notice that I'm kind of a geek about chargers. I love having a way to charge my electronics when I'm not near a wall outlet. So right away I was interested in this case.I'll address my major misgiving first: the charge/discharge issue with portable chargers. This isn't usually an issue with larger chargers, but this problem is magnified with smaller chargers. With chargers smaller than about 3,000 mAh, or even with larger chargers that aren't fully charged, you can get to a point where the appliance you're trying to charge (your iPhone, in this case) has more power left in its battery than the charger does, so the charge actually goes in the wrong direction and your phone ends up getting drained until the charge in the phone and the charger reach equilibrium. That's not good. Even though the battery and the phone still have some charge left at that point, the slow reverse drool of power between the two batteries works against you and ends up draining both batteries. I've done the same thing with my Kindle tablet and a larger power bank that wasn't fully charged.Anyway, that's a geeky point, but it's a crucial issue with a small 2,300 mAh charger and an iPhone. LifeCharge's solution is simple and effective. They put a power switch on their case. That may not seem like a big deal, but it's huge. Just use your phone normally until the battery gets down to whatever percentage you're comfortable with (say 10%-20%). Then press the power button on the charger case to begin charging your phone. The charger will quickly charge your phone back up to nearly 100% again. Awesome!My second misgiving was that this would add too much bulk to the phone. I'd seen a couple of guys in the past who had charging cases and they looked awful. This one isn't as bulky as I'd feared though. It adds about a quarter inch to the thickness and a half inch to the length of the phone. It's really not bad. I don't leave mine attached to the phone all the time, but I keep it in my briefcase. If I know I'm going to be working late or stuck in a meeting, I can grab the case and not have to worry about my battery life.The case has two parts: a top and a bottom. The two pieces slide apart and make it very easy to install/remove the case if you don't want to leave it on all the time.It feels kind of funny to charge it with a micro-USB cable (provided). I'm so used to connecting a lightning cable to my phone, but the case uses the more common micro-USB cable. I guess the nice thing about that is if time is short I can actually use two cables to quickly charge my phone and this case separately before I have to run off again.The case also provides decent protection for the phone. It is made of a rubberized hard shell that protects the back and all four corners (but not the face). Everyone is different, but that's just how I like my cases.So I initially had my doubts about this case, but they were all addressed in the product itself and I was really worried over nothing. This is a good case. It's useful to me and does what I need it to do: It gives me about one good charge (plus a little extra) for my iPhone.

There seem to be two common designs of a case like this, both two-piece:  one that detaches at the top third of the case, and the other that uses a top frame to secure the phone.  This LifeCharge case uses the first design.  I like this design best over the two because the iPhone can be slid out in a straight line instead of approaching the lightning connector at a slight angle.  I don't have to worry about damaging the lightning connection in my phone.

After all, you are attaching an extra battery to the back of your phone.  The good news is that batteries are getting lighter and thinner, and so are the cases.  I can fit this in my back pocket without a problem, although people who carry their phones in their front pockets will likely find it uncomfortable.I get about 1.5 charges out of this case.

Use of this LifeCharge Case will more than double the lifespan of your iPhone. Charging itself was very quick and effective.What distinguishes this battery case form some of its competitors is that it&#8217;s MFI certified by Apple. This means that you will not have to worry about whether it will stop working with your iPhone if Apple changes its specifications in some future version of iOS ar the phone firmware.One issue that I have with this iPhone case is that it uses the micro USB port for its charging. This is an odd choice of charging input, especially considering that this case is Apple certified. iPhone charging case that doesn&#8217;t use the lightning cable is also not a very appealing marketing move. This choice of charging input will mean that you will not be able to sue any of the iPhone specific accessories and stands (like some external speakers for instance) that you might have.

And if you compare cases with equal amounts of mAh capacity, they will deliver equal amounts of power for your particular phone and your particular usage patterns.This case with incorporated extra battery power is nicely made.  It performs as stated on this product page.  You can buy it with confidence; it will perform.What makes it different from the many others that I've reviewed in the past few months?  Two things:  One of which I like, one which I don't like.  Turns out, after giving it a lot of thought, I dislike one feature more than I like another feature:  Hence, a four-star rating, rather than a five-star rating.  You, on the other hand, might feel that my dislike is no biggie.  Anyway, I'll make the point and you decide.  I just want to help you decide.As far as size goes, this case is so minimally heavier than the last case I reviewed as to be a non-issue:  It weighs a tiny one-tenth of an ounce more than some other battery-included cases I have been experimenting with.  Move the phone from one hand to the other and you cannot notice extra weight.  Comparing dimensions, this case is a little longer than some, but no thicker.  Yes, it is thicker than a regular case, but the battery has to go somewhere.  It is definitely a more convenient and lighter-weight and less bulky choice than a separate external battery.This is my nit-pickiness:  I do not like the angled edges compared to rounded curves of other cases.  It is not bulkier, the &#34;faceted&#34; edges just make it feel bulkier and not ergonomically correct.  I just don't like to hold this phone.  My complaint has nothing to do with the case's performance, which is great.  (I have long, thin fingers; not meaty at all.)This is what I consider a very nice feature, and I've not seen it done this way before:  The top third of the case slides off so that you can slide your phone in.  It is very secure.  Other cases have a removable frame around the whole phone.Another nice feature are all the speaker holes that go across the entire bottom-front of the case.  Other cases have  limited holes or a cut out for where the phone's speakers are.*I received a sample product from Ontrion.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quality battery phone case; not as ergonomically easy to hold as some others", "unixReviewTime": 1393372800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014"}

Let me say up front that there is a trade-off, but one I am glad to make: this takes the sleek 5S and adds a little extra size to it. Width wise the increase is nominal as is the weight. It does make it about a half inch taller, so if you love the phone's original size this will detract slightly from the aesthetics.Looks aren't everything, though, because use time is more important to me and I am not always around a charger. The 2300mAh capacity of the integrated battery is almost 1.5 times that of the 5S' internal 1560mAh battery. Even accounting for loss from charging that is still twice the use time of a 5S without this case, which is why I love it.Another feature I love is the way the case protects the phone. While Apple builds their phones to withstand a lot of abuse, this case adds another layer of protection. It is shock resistant, and the way the outer lip is slightly raised gives the screen more protection if you drop the phone in a carpeted office.Others have described how this case works and fit and form, so I am not going to repeat that information. I will say that the final selling point for me is this case earned Apple's MFi (Made for iPhone) certification, which gives me peace of mind. There are too many products on the market that are of shoddy quality or from fly-by-night outfits, so the certification is not only meaningful, but worth a premium price to me.

Lerch", "helpful": [9, 10], "reviewText": "If you are looking for a great on phone battery extender, there are plenty of options. I have reviewed a few other extended batteries and have used them all. The LifeCHARGE doesn't bring anything outstanding or innovative to the table, but that's hard to do when these things are pretty close to perfection as it stands.That being said, the LifeCHARGE is a great choice if you need an extended battery. The price is good and the performance is just what you expect. The internal battery is a 2300 mAh battery, a little more than the iPhone itself. This extra bit is actually wasted energy as no battery is 100% efficient. So that extra bit of power ensures you get 100% more phone time than what you have now.In terms of using the battery, slide the case apart, slide your phone in, connecting the Lightning connection into the port. Slide the piece back on and now you have a phone cover and 100% more battery life with the ease of USB charging.When you want to use the battery, you actually have to press a button on the back of the case to begin charging the phone's internal battery. All of these cases are designed like this and I believe this is to extend the life of both your phone battery and the charge case battery by only charging when needed. The 4 bars on the back of the case indicate charge level, and once charging is complete they shut off.A nice feature that some of the original cases I used didn't have is that this is designed so you don't need an extender on a headphone jack. One less thing to carry is one less thing to carry.And the one less thing to carry goes with not having to carry a Lightning charger. Chances are pretty high you have other digital devices in your life that charge with micro USB. This means if you travel you can just take one USB micro charge cable and you can charge your phone, the extended battery and whatever else you need. And of course, that assumes you don't need to charge more than one device at a time, in which case you will be carrying multiple cables anyway...Overall this is a really well designed case that fits on the iPhone 5s perfectly.

This would not only take up room in my travel bag, but in hotel rooms with so few outlets, lead to tough choices on what to charge first.With this charger, I can not only charge four devices at once, but I get a substantially quicker charge versus using an OEM charger.  With a 4A total capacity, this unit has double the capacity you will currently find available elsewhere for most 4 port USB wall chargers.  Typical chargers like the very popularAmazon Kindle PowerFast chargerare only rated at 1.8A and 9W and can only charge ONE device at a time; for roughly the same price you can get this Bolse 4 Port wall charger that is rated 4A and 20W and can charge simultaneously up to 4 gadgets.One feature I really like about this newly updated charger is how it is designed.  Yes, the fold up outlet prong is fantastic, but the best part is that each port is labeled for what it can charge.  Often times you will see the outlets described in the user sheet that comes with the product, but lose that paper, and your outlets are no longer identified.  This charger has 4 universal ports you can use to charge anything, but 2 of those ports have special designations as well.  It has been found that some iDevice's and Samsung Android products require specially designed charging ports to draw a charge.  This unit has 2 of its four ports label \"iPad/U\" and \"Sam/U\", indicating those respective ports are universal but were also specially designed with Apple or Samsung hardware charging needs in mind.  This unit also features a dulled amber power indication light, wonderful for those who don't like bright lights on their chargers.  This is a fantastic design change from the previous model by this manufacture which had a brighter blue light.Considering all options available on the market today, TheBolse 4-Port High Output USB Rapid Chargeris a tremendous value for the price.  It's well designed for the gadget obsessed to keep all your gear powered at home and on the go.  I would recommend this product to anyone who seeks to simplify their device charging methods, truly a must have.Disclosure: I want you to know I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

People who use the USB ports on the computer or older wall chargers with only 2.1 A will really appreciate the faster charging times for devices that can accommodate 4 A.  The higher output is maintained even when all four USB ports are in use.Those ports are underneath to ease cord tangle and strain and are clearly labelled. All are universal for use with most devices including the newer ones from Apple.  One is also designed to also be compatible with older Apple devices and another with Samsung devices but not with iPad.  It sounds confusing, but iPad and Galaxy owners are familiar with these issues!To get the best use from any USB charger, it is important to understand the requirements of each device and its battery. Manufacturers provide this information; Apple's website, for instance, provides a full page of information about each device's battery. iPad batteries should be completely discharged and then fully recharged monthly, while iPod batteries don't need to be cycled. Some electronics should be turned off or put in sleep mode for charging under certain circumstances. It definitely is worth the time to learn about these requirements.This Bolse wall charger works very well as a permanent charging station but it is also convenient for travel.  It weighs 4 oz. and is just a tad over 3 in. long.  The offset non-polarized prongs are well-protected but are easy to unfold, and they are secure in the wall outlet or power strip.

It allows me to consolidate multiple wall-chargers into one \"charging station\". Since I don't like to crawl under tables or behind desks, I mounted this unit over a kitchen counter for a charge spot \"on the way out of the house\".The yellow power-on LED is a welcome change from the glaring blue LEDs that have been recently popular on small electronics. The unit is sleek enough to fit onto a standard US wall outlet without obstructing the other outlet. The plug's prongs are identical, allowing it to mount with USB ports facing up or down. The 100-240V input (50-60HZ) means you only need a simple pin-adapter (at most) to use this unit during your global travels.According to a power meter, I was able to draw 15W through this unit (while simultaneously charging a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, a Motorola Moto G, and an Ipod Touch), making the advertised 20W specification easily achievable. With no attached loads, draw was less than 1W, meaning this unit won't add to the \"vampire draw\" of electrical devices in my house (my power meter only registers 1W and up).The only issue I experienced was that my unit's folding power prongs unfold to the 45-degree mark very easily, essentially pulling out of the wall if I tug on the USB cables. Since there's enough slack in my cables, this doesn't happen very often, but it would be nice if the prongs would lock into place when fully extended. Other than the prong-locking issue, the unit feels solid and well-made.Other thoughts: The Samsung/Apple ports aren't as well explained as I'd like-- they're designed to provide higher power flow when they detect certain types of devices on the basis of a particular USB signal. A per-port LED showing that the device is drawing power would be nice, even nicer would be some indication that it was drawing power at the \"higher\" setting.[ I was given this product to review. I received no compensation, and this review is my honest opinion. ]Recommended for consolidated wall-charging of USB devices.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "compact and useful 4-port charger", "unixReviewTime": 1392076800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2014"}

Newell \"Bob\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I was given a free sample for review purposes, however my reviews are unbiased and frank.I'd previously reviewed a similar Bolse product; this one appears to be an update. It will charge up to four USB devices at once, and outputs up to 4 amps, or 1 amp per device. This is in my opinion the right way to do things; it will charge devices fast enough but not too fast (other devices offer 2 amps on a single port; this is fine for quick charging but I do not think fast charging is so good for battery longevity).The unit has overload, overheat, and overcharging protection, which I consider a must-have feature, as potentially damaging your devices is not acceptable.The charger is quite portable; the prongs fold down for storage and transportation. It's relatively small and lightweight, though a little bigger than the earlier similar product (and there's a good reason for this as I'll describe). It enables two people to charge their phones and tablets all at once and all from one electrical outlet position. This is incredibly convenient for travel (just don't forget to bring all the cables).The difference between this unit and the older one, and the reason for the larger size, is that there is a little more room between the USB plug-in positions on the front of the unit. This makes it easier to insert and remove cabless; the small increase in overall size is a reasonable trade-off.Note that if you're using a power strip, you'll have to put this at the end. I don't consider that a drawback; most likely you'll plug it into a standard outlet in most cases. A small tip: use the upper position in a standard 2-outlet fixture, as that makes it much easier to insert and remove the USB cables.Five stars and definitely recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice update of an excellent earlier product", "unixReviewTime": 1390176000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2014"}

Inside the box was the Speaker, an instruction manual, an Aux Cable and a Micro USB charging cable. The first thing you see is the rugged design of the speaker with the cable for hanging the speaker.  It has rubberized feet on the top and bottom and a rubber cover over the Micro USB charging port and the aux port.  It is made for outdoor use.  It looks pretty impressive. It has a single button for power and pairing.  It does not have a volume adjustment so your device fully controls the speaker volume. It looks like it is designed and built well.&#9830; Installation - I plugged in the included Mini USB charging cable into the unit and into a USB wall charger to give it an initial charge before testing it out.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the speaker was charged, a did a variety of tests to try it out using my iPhone 5S.Test #1 (Sound Quality Test) - I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to some Pop Music to Excision Bass Heavy Dubstep (the Destroid album), and the speaker sounded really great in all situations.  It had no distortion and reached some pretty high volumes. It had really good bass sounds for a small speaker, but not booming bass (this is not a negative because no tiny speaker can produce booming bass). It sounded really good overall.Test #2 (Sound Performance Test) - After I got past the basic sound quality, I tried out a few more technical tests. I put speaker directly in front of me and started playing a Dolby HD Surround Sound test video. It sounded really good, but as you would expect, there are no real surround or stereo capabilities from a single speaker setup. I also played a frequency test file that started at 20Hz and found that the speaker started producing sound around the 33Hz range, which is pretty low. The sound continued with sound being audible all the way up to 15000Hz. Great range for a small speaker.Test #3 (Use Test) - I tested the Bluetooth range by walking through my house and got really far away, more than 20 feet around several walls, before the sound dropped out. Walking back started the sound back up immediately. Overall, the range was really good and better than many Bluetooth speakers that I have tested. Once the sound testing was done via Bluetooth streaming, I tried out the sound from the Aux input cable from my iPhone and it sounded just as good. The hanging cable has a carabiner hook with a locking mechanism that is really secure.  It can be used to hang the speaker from a hook, a tree branch, or just about anything else up to about 3 inches in diameter.  The speaker can also just be set on a table.

Except for an on/off button, there is no way to control your music from the speaker.I am impressed with the distance I can move away from my device--in my test case, a laptop where ALL my music is stored.  The manual claims 10 meters (about 33 feet), but I think that is being very modest.  I was able to move at least 60' away, through a wall and a closed glass window without the sound breaking.

The speaker quickly paired as device &#34;Sabrent BYTA&#34; with no code required. Music sounded very good, and lyrics were clear. Instrumental songs were also good, with decent bass sound for such a small speaker.The speaker does not have some of the features that other portable speakers often have. There are no volume, run/pause, and forward/back controls on the speaker - those must be controlled from the audio source. Also, the speaker cannot be used for hands-free cellphone calls. If the audio source has no Bluetooth, an audio cable (included) can be used to connect the speaker with the source if the source device has a 3.5mm audio jack. In the hardwired mode, the volume and track controls must be set from the source (this is always the case with any Bluetooth speaker, however). The specs indicate that the usable range of the speaker is 10 meters (33 feet) from the source. I found this to be fairly accurate, although I did notice an occasional brief hiccup at distances less than 33 feet.The speaker has a built-in rechargeable battery that when fully charged will give 5-6 hours of play, according to the user guide. (The product description page shows up to 10 hours, a discrepancy.)  I recharged the speaker with a 5V~0.85A AC wall charger overnight, and it worked fine.One very appreciated feature is the rubber-coated steel lanyard with a locking carabiner clip. This would be good for hanging the speaker or for attaching the speaker to your belt. Either way, it's not going anywhere.With 2 watts of output sound, the Sabrent speaker won't replace a boom box for big sound, but for lesser needs, especially in damp, humid conditions, the speaker would be a good choice if you don't mind controlling the sound from the audio source, since the speaker lacks audio controls.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for indoor/outdoor use, especially in damp conditions", "unixReviewTime": 1389312000, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2014"}

{"reviewerID": "A145B8OHVNNFAJ", "asin": "B00HIUL1JO", "reviewerName": "Steward Willons", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "The Sabrent is a small speaker offering mediocre sound quality with a bit more power than you might expect from something this small. The portable Bluetooth speaker market is being flooded with options, and since I&#8217;ve recently had a chance to review three similar models, I&#8217;ll provide some points of comparison.First off, I&#8217;ll say that the sound quality of tiny speakers like this is marginal at best, but sound quality isn&#8217;t exactly the point when you&#8217;re dealing with this sort of thing. If you&#8217;re expecting deep bass, detailed midrange, and crystalline highs from a tiny speaker in a plastic enclosure, then you need to revisit high school physics because it&#8217;s just not possible. When I compare sound quality between the following Bluetooth speakers, keep in mind that quality is relative. Even the best sounding portable Bluetooth speaker is going to sound shallow and anemic when compared with conventional speakers.Second, the Bluetooth functionality works reasonably well. Syncing is as straightforward as it can be. However, I&#8217;m not a big fan of the control interface. There is only one button and it&#8217;s used to control power and syncing. I wish there was a separate button for syncing, but it at least offers a better experience than the Antec SP Zero, which I mention below.Third, the Sabrent is very ruggedly built. It&#8217;s made for outdoor use, so it can be around some water without getting ruined. I&#8217;m not in love with the design because it seems like a lot of space is wasted on the carabineer snap hook, but whatever. It&#8217;s so inexpensive that it doesn&#8217;t matter.Now for the comparison.Antec SP Zero (approximately $50-70). The Antec sits right in the middle of the pack both in terms of price and in terms of sound quality. The bass gives the impression of being punchy, although on a smaller scale than you would find with larger speakers. The mids and highs are reasonable, but nothing too amazing. Anyone telling you differently either has very low standards for aural excellence or has not had a chance to audition the competition.Sabrent Mini Outdoor Portable Bluetooth Speaker (approximately $20). The Sabrent model is the cheapest by far and it actually plays louder than the Antec. It&#8217;s bass extends slightly deeper as well. The highs are duller than the Antec and the Edifier, but sometimes volume can make up for quality, especially if you&#8217;re using this outdoors.Edifier MP260 Extreme (approximately $80). The Edifier is the most expensive option, but at only $30 more than the Antec, it&#8217;s actually a huge step up in sound quality and volume level. Sure, it&#8217;s a bit bigger in size, but it&#8217;s still very portable and weighs about the same as all three models. It actually has some decent bass response, partially due to the larger enclosure. It uses two drivers where the Sabrent and the Antec use only one.Since each of the above speakers are similarly sized and share the exact same functionality as far as Bluetooth connectivity, the real question is: how much do you want to spend and what level of sound quality are you satisfied with? The Sabrent is a great value and plays louder than the Antec. The Edifier is more expensive, but the sound quality and volume are superior to the others. Unfortunately, this means the Antec is not remarkable in any capacity. Compared to the Sabrent, it&#8217;s too expensive and doesn&#8217;t do anything to justify its price.Overall, I can recommend the Sabrent to anyone who wants a very affordable, durable Bluetooth speaker. The sound isn&#8217;t amazing, but at this price, it sounds better than one would expect.Disclosure: I received this product from Sabrent to review.

Schmidt", "helpful": [13, 14], "reviewText": "*Disclosure: I was contacted by a representative for OXA and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of giving my thoughts on it.*Let me start this off by saying that I was very concerned about what follows.  Looking at all the glowing reviews this item has, I figured I must have gotten a broken one or something.  Contacting OXA however revealed that no, the watch that was sent to me was not broken, it was functioning just as it was supposed to.  That bites.  I was really excited about getting this product, I wanted it to be great.  I understood it wasn't in the same class as myPebble Smartwatch), and that was ok. I do my best to be honest in my reviews and report only what I know to be true. Given how different my experience was with this watch, which is backed up by the company that makes it, I'm eyeing those positive reviews and reviewers very suspiciously.  Also related in my communication with OXA  is that they are committed to improving their products and have a new version on the way. It's a few weeks out from the time of this writing.  The new version will have the features this one was supposed to have but doesn't.  Nor will this version be upgradeable to the get those features.The construction itself feels good.  It's a solid bit of plastic, that's for sure.  The two buttons on the side are set nicely, not detracting from the look of the watch but also not being a pain in the rear to get at and use when needed.  The charging manner is, well, really goofy.  A custom two prong affair with a binder clip like thing to hold the prongs to the watch.  Ok, really, I think I've seen middle school kids knock up something better for their science fair projects.  Break that clip, lose that cable, and good luck getting it replaced.  The speaker are weak, but I'll get to that later.  The screen, which doesn't stay on full time so as to save battery life, is dim.  OLED is may be, but its hard to see even in the shade.  Taking it into sunlight and it's unreadable.For testing, I used two different phones.  An HTC EVO 4G LTE, and an HTC One.  The results of my testing were the same regardless of which one I used.  Both phones work just fine with other Bluetooth devices, including headsets, speakers, speakerphones, and in-car hands-free calling systems.  I thought at first maybe there was a difference between using an iPhone vs an Android phone.  But no, OXA didn't specify that it worked with one better than the other when I contacted them.  Directions were followed exactly according to the included manual.  Pairing up wasn't at all difficult, and worked consistently.  According the the ad here, the watch has an \"Alarm clock reminder\" function.  Yeah, no.  The watch tells time (military time/24HR clock only), acts like a minimal hands-free calling device, can play music/sound from your phone, but that's about it.  The \"display the number of incoming calls while receiving a call or receiving a message\" isn't there either.  (Next version, says OXA.)  When calls or messages come in, the bracelet shows the volume level it's set to, and that's it.Speaking of sound, now seems to be a good time to talk about that.  The watch has an independent volume setting from your phone, which, if done right, isn't a bad thing.  It's not done right.  The bracelet is 100% dependant on the volume setting on your phone for everything, which is common with many Bluetooth speakers.  But when it comes to headsets and hands-free devices, this isn't the case.  Say you want this watch to be what emits a ringtone when you get message, as well as vibrate.  It can do this, but only if the volume on your phone is also turned up.  If your phone is on vibrate or silent, the bracelet sits there like a lump.  If you have a short ringtone, the sound is cut off at the beginning.  When you're playing a game on your phone, the bracelet acts as a second speaker.  When playing music, or any type of media, the bracelet will again act as a second speaker.  The only way to get the bracelet to not to do the second speaker trick is to turn its volume all the way down and then hope to remember to turn it back up again so you can hear notifications.  It will not act as the only speaker for any media playback.Doing calls is a shaking activity.  If you sit real still, there is no breeze or background noise, have the call volume on the phone set just right, have the bracelet's volume set just right, you can have a good clear call.  Change any one of those variables and the call quality plummets.  Using it while driving?  Probably not.  Using it for a conference call?  Unlikely.To summarize, this watch doesn't meet it's own description of functions.  I wasn't expecting that it could do everything my Pebble does or that Galaxy Gear can.  But I did expect it to meet its claims, and it doesn't.  To add insult to injury, the features it does have are half baked and rigged to the point of making it more of a pain to use than anything else.  Other OXA products I've gotten have been pretty good quality stuff, so this was an unexpected disappointment and I do hope that the new version is a whole lot better.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Save yourself some time", "unixReviewTime": 1395187200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2014"}

I'll get the issues out of the way first.The biggest thing I dislike is the clamp style charging cable. It takes some adroit maneuvering to correctly connect it. You are rewarded with a brief indication on the display when you do have the pins lined up, but to be honest, I get it about fifty percent of the time, and fumble in frustration the other fifty percent of my attempts. A micro USB port on the underside of this bracelet would eliminate one of my two biggest complaints.My other peeve is pairing and connecting. After I finally paired it successfully with my Galaxy Note 3 I went through the same drill with an iPad 2. Even if you follow the directions to a T you need to be lucky with the time when you 'lightly press' the B button. Speaking of which, perhaps a small middle button specifically for pairing would solve that issue. Or, if there is enough remaining electronic real estate on the circuit board, employ the newer style bluetooth that makes itself known to scanning devices automatically. There are a number of speakers on the market that do just that and it's a dream come true, especially for novices.As for the military time display, it is not a problem for me since I am a retired officer, but I can certainly understand complaints about that as a limitation. This would be a lot more appealing if it used twelve hour AM/PM format.The speaker itself is sufficiently loud and clear for phone calls and streaming music into your personal space. I made and received a few test calls and had no issues whatsoever. Music sounds adequate if you love having something in the background. It isn't designed for critical listening and does not claim to be.I've owned and reviewed other OXA products and love their quality.

I've found the Oxa Bluetooth watch useful when driving or when going someplace noisy where I can't hear my phone in my purse. It's good for any time holding a phone in my hand is not convenient.FORM FACTORMy wrist is small. This Bluetooth bracelet is not adjustable. I have to wear it higher up my arm to keep it still.The watch face is large and clunky, which is deceptive, because the digital display does not fill the screen. It's very small. In fact, I still can't tell what one of the icons is supposed to be.I can read the time (military time, we have no choice), but only if it is indoor lighting. Dimmer light is better. It's impossible to read outdoors, even in the shade.The watch charges with a proprietary cord that is very sensitive to being moved. I prefer the more universal micro USB cord. If I lose the charging cable, I would no longer be able to use my watch.BLUETOOTHIt was easy to pair with my iPhone 4S. Reconnection is automatic when I turn on the watch. Range is excellent. It is better than any other Bluetooth device that I own, which is a lot. When I go out of range, my watch vibrates to let me know a connection has been lost. If I come back within a short period (minutes), it will reconnect. If not, nothing happens.This watch is supposed to search for a signal every ten minutes. Not true.SOUNDIf you want to listen to music on your wrist, it's just okay. I don't think it was made for that. We get that small speaker quality.If you want to make and take calls, it's much better. My daughter helps me with a lot of my Bluetooth speakers, most of which have failed in the phone call department. This is the first one where the first words out of her mouth were, \"I love it!\"I have to say, I can hear her and every other caller just fine on this watch. They come in loud and clear. No one ever asks me to repeat myself, either. I went and tried it out as a caller and found that there is a slight echo when I talk, but it's not bad enough to prevent a conversation.The one thing I would like for phone calls is a way to set the ring on vibrate. In fact, I'd like to be able to set the watch to vibrate only for texts and everything else. As it is, it will vibrate and ring for phone calls, and I get whatever tone the phone plays for messages.I'd like the texts to show on the face of the watch. Maybe they do. Most of the time, I'm in a place that's too bright for me to read the display.OVERALL IMPRESSIONI like the whole concept, and I like that the phone calls come in so clearly. I like being able to hold a conversation and I like the anti-theft or loss feature that vibrates when the phone is too far. I just wish the watch was smaller and the display was brighter and larger.This product was provided for review by Oxa.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good for Calls On the Go", "unixReviewTime": 1396915200, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2014"}

The OXA products we have used have been very effective and reliable, but this Bluetooth Wristwatch seems to have so much more potential than found in its current form. It is futuristic looking, keeps good time (military format) and plays music nicely over its speaker, but there are a couple drawbacks that need to be overcome for this product to really take off.To start -- pairing the wristwatch with our mobile phones was easy to do, and the contact list sharing made it so that inbound calls show the name and number of the caller on the wristwatch's display. That is a nice touch.However, the wristwatch has a very small wrist opening for the American market, and it is made of hard plastic that does not flex, bend or give in any way when trying to get it on. The youngest person we asked to try it on was able to get it on his wrist, but nobody over the age of 12 years old could comfortably get the watch onto their wrist. Those adults that were able to get the watch on found it to be less comfortable than desired, actually restrictively tight, because the plastic is so hard and the band so small.  If this could be made with softer, flexible rubber it would receive much stronger reviews.If you would like to see pictures I took of it, please navigate to the wristwatch's main sales page, scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section. Tried my best to take pictures that do justice to this nice case, but it is hard to take pictures of black items using regular indoor lighting. Cool looking futuristic wristwatch.In the Amazon listing, OXA states that the \"Max circumference 6.5 inches, more suitable for girl's wrist\". I think that OXA is trying to convey that it is best for young children with small wrists, and I agree with that. However, if marketing to young kids or to young girls, they might try colors like pink, green, yellow, purple, blue. etc... instead of just black or white. Our skinny teenager has a 7 inch wrist circumference and it wasn't comfortable for him to put on easily or wear.The charging device is very odd, hard to use and difficult to fit. A redesign using micro USB port on one end would seem a good idea here. Not sure if we ever got it fully charged.The biggest challenge for us was the one-way Bluetooth communication. The wrist watch plays music from your Bluetooth source device very well, and it does a good job as a speaker phone for inbound calls, but it does not have a two-way Bluetooth connection and is unable to initiate outbound calls or outbound voice-texts. To use with outbound calls you have to make the call from your phone and then 'transfer' the call to the wristwatch.  Two-way functionality would have made this a big hit even if the fit wasn't optimal, and we have other items in this price range with two-way Bluetooth capabilities... so it can be done.The OXA wrist watch keeps time very well, and the display is easy to read. We very much like the idea of the Bluetooth wrist watch, and hope to see additional functionality in your future offerings.I did not find warranty information with the product packaging or on the Amazon listing, but the OXAUSA website states \"Any items sold by OXA have 1 year guarantee. What's more, OXA will extend the warranty time for half a year.\" The extension is typically if you go to their Facebook page and like them there... If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this unit gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for a fun novelty for a person with a small wrist circumference, allowing them to stream music via Bluetooth, tell time, and take incoming calls, then this item may be exactly what you are looking for. If looking for a full function 'Dick Tracy' style two-way wristwatch communicator, this product is not there yet.Again, OXA has a great product line and excellent customer service, and I would not hesitate to purchase products from them in the future.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "OXA Bluetooth Wristwatch Bracelet - Keeps good military time - Easy to read - Plays music well - Small - Inbound calls only", "unixReviewTime": 1396828800, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2014"}

{"reviewerID": "A3V79KXIY09MOE", "asin": "B00HQZU8G8", "reviewerName": "Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"", "helpful": [7, 9], "reviewText": "Ah, Bluetooth; a wonderful way to connect wirelessly to a multitude of products. While convenient to use at home, I would hazard a guess that most people mainly use this medium to pair a headset with their cell phone(s). And, as technology has gotten better and better, the availability of devices is as varied not only in their design, but also their functionality. But the coolest part about all of this? We are getting closer and closer to what was once Sci-Fi gadgetry and are capable of having a communicator wristwatch just like James Bond!ConstructionThe OXA Bluetooth Wristwatch/Bracelet (henceforth referred to as \"OXABW\") is constructed of durable plastic materials that feel both solid and lightweight. The face of the bracelet/watch is on the top of the unit as the center section; the battery charging contacts are located on the back side of the face. The curved part that is below the center section (with the OXA logo painted in silver) houses the speaker, while the upper curved portion has the microphone. The undersides of both curved pieces have a thin rubber backing so that the bracelet is comfortable against your skin. Finally, on the right side of the face are two buttons that you use to pair/set the time/connect & disconnect calls, and basically control the bracelet's functions.In order to charge the unit, you must clamp the charger using a spring clip from the left side (if looking at the bracelet from above with the OXA logo at the bottom). This clip \"bites\" onto the bracelet and has two prongs that line up with the two contact ports on the underside of the center section (the \"face\"). The other end of the charging cord uses a standard male USB adapter that enables you to plug it into your computer and/or other device that has an open USB port.UsageFirst, please allow me to be clear: while a nifty device, this bracelet is not as advanced as the Samsung Galaxy Gear Watch. On a spectrum, the OXABW is on the lower end of the price/functionality spectrum. Now, that does not mean that the bracelet is useless! In fact, I was very impressed with the features that it DOES have. To test this bracelet, I paired it with two different devices: the first was my iPod Touch (4th gen), and the second was my Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone. Each device presented a different experience from the OXABW. With both of these devices, I was able to quickly pair the bracelet with no issue.iPod TouchWith the iPod, while the bracelet was able to play music, I learned that it was not something that should be your primary speaker source. The sound quality was \"okay\", but streaming music non-stop quickly drained the battery. In addition, the only three things that I could do while playing music was adjust the volume with the two side buttons, set/check the time, and/or check the (rapidly depleting) battery level. I could not even advance to the next song on the playlist; I had to do that using the iPod itself. So while you can use this bracelet to listen to music, I recommend investing in a Bluetooth speaker dedicated to just that task.Samsung Galaxy S2While the functionality of the bracelet with my iPod was lackluster at best, the OXABW comes into its own when paired with a smartphone. In addition to being able to answer calls and speak with the other party through the bracelet (it functions as a speakerphone), it has other handy features that I found to be convenient. For example: once the bracelet is paired, it will vibrate to alert you that your phone is more than 10 meters away, thus acting as a \"finder\" of sorts. It is also smart enough to know that your phone is on vibrate, and will not make a sound when alerting you of an incoming call (the caller's phone number will display, with no spaces, on the face of the bracelet; you answer the phone call by clicking the lower button on the right side of the unit). Conversely, if you have your ringtone turned on, it will vibrate AND make a noise to alert you to a call. When it vibrates/chimes to indicate that you received a text message, it will mimic the sound that your phone makes. Finally, if you have an alarm set on your phone, the OXABW will also vibrate/sound to alert you that the time has reached the point you designated!OverallIn the end, I can attest that the bracelet is a fun gadget to have, even with its flaws. The easiest way to explain this is below:Pros1. The OLED interface is simple but easy to read; you can see the time, battery level, and phone icon (which indicates that your device is paired to your phone/music player) clearly.2. The bracelet vibrates to let you know that you are out of range/left your phone behind to prevent losing it.3. As long as you are not streaming music or talking for hours, the battery life is excellent.4. The call clarity is excellent through the speaker; when speaking to a friend using the microphone on the bracelet, he indicated that the sound quality was even better than my Plantronics Bluetooth headset.5. Is lightweight and only slightly bulky; you will want to wear it on the wrist opposite your writing hand; otherwise it is uncomfortable to rest against the table.Cons1. The prongs to charge the phone are very narrow in diameter; if you are not careful when you are clamping the charger clip over the bracelet, they look like they will snap easily.2. Since the bracelet only has two buttons, you have to remember the proper way to sync, set the time, answer a call, and once a call is answered how to pass it over to the phone (rather than speaking through the bracelet), and it takes a few times to get used to the procedures.3. If you have the OXABW paired to one device, and then decide to use it on another, you need to turn the bracelet completely off and then enter pairing mode in order to recognize the other device; if you have the old device nearby, sometimes it will still sync to that unit and not the new one, even if the new one is in discovery mode.4. The Caller ID only lists the phone number (smashed together with no spaces); it should also be able to list the name assigned to each number from my contact list. In addition, when it alerts you to receiving a text message, it would be nice if it either showed the name or phone number of the sender.5. The answer button is touchy; I have answered calls more than once and accidentally hung up without even realizing I had.6. The instruction book has been badly translated from Chinese and can be hard to follow; for example: one page says to hold down the \"A\" button for two seconds to transfer a call from the bracelet to the phone; the next page over says to hold the \"A\" button down for two seconds to disconnect.As I mentioned above, ultimately this is a neat little gadget to have, and is definitely more in my price range than many of the other Bluetooth devices out there. That being said, the features that the OXA Bluetooth Wristwatch has are the bare-minimum, and I find it hard to justify paying the full $50 for this. If the device were updated to include the actual name of the caller (from your contacts), as well as the ability to read your text messages from the phone, I could see paying the full price asked. For now, though, while fun in a geeky kind of way, I would wait until the next generation of this product and a few more features before you commit to buy it.**Disclaimer: This bracelet was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

Step one: Plug in your in and out cable to the speaker and your CD player, radio, etc. You will need to press the Play (multi mode) button and hold it down. The speaker will realize that it has an audio cable in it so it will be ready to play in regular mode in the speaker (like a regular non Bluetooth type of speaker).

I was struck by the small size and had doubts about the sound until I connected my Galaxy Note 3 via bluetooth and started streaming music.First I want to talk about set up. It's simple! The earlier generations of speakers that I own required you to remember how long to press and hold a multi-function button to turn it on, off and to connect to a bluetooth enabled device. In some cases I think chanting was involved, but this one is refreshingly different. You turn it on and off with a switch on the bottom and the buttons, such as they are, work without knowing magic sequences. My speaker came up broadcasting its presence, which my phone immediately detected when I initiated a scan. It connected and within mere minutes of unboxing this thing I was streaming music to it. Granted I broke the cardinal rule of charging it first, but I did connect the included charging cable to my Galaxy Note 3's wall charger.Sound is the biggest surprise. I expected it to sound thin and tinny, but it has a much richer sound with good coverage of the frequency spectrum from bass through upper register instruments. The sound quality when it's within a few yards is perfect to my ears. The range of the device itself is within the limits in the product description (I test such things). In other words, this is everything claimed, including the five hours of total play time on a fully charged unit.One final note: this sounds as nice when attached via the 3.5mm port using the supplied cable. I mention this because some speakers work with bluetooth, but have poor hardwired sound. So if you are purchasing this as an axillary speaker for a computer it will work just as well as when receiving streamed music from any other device.Take my experience and the other reviews into account.

It may still be useful in a docked-laptop config, allowing the audio to be relocated.Tested on a 2013 Macbook Pro, bluetooth connection was easy, but did drop 1-2x during an hour of sporadic usage (notably not pairing back up when the laptop exited sleep mode). More annoying, the speaker remains \"listening\" for a moment before and after a sound is transmitted to it, and apparently plays whatever signal it receives. That means there's a buzz of static before/after playing intermittent audio like MacOS system sounds. Presumably it's picking up other RF transmissions and not filtering them out (no other bluetooth devices were in use at the time). A different brand of bluetooth speaker used on the same Macbook in the same location doesn't exhibit this behavior.Strangely, the power connector is the now-obsolete Mini-USB (not MicroUSB). Mini-USB is less common for several reasons including its larger connector and a design specification that makes for a less sturdy connector (shorter lifespan). I have other Oxa products, which all use the standard MicroUSB, so I'm not sure why this product has an obsolete connector.Also a little odd, the generic-looking box said this unit was OXA0041, the bottom of the unit says BL-03, and it shows up in Bluetooth as KR012. Directions are not necessary, but the included ones are in an illegibly small font.There's an on-off switch and an AUX audio input. Audio input cable is included. Rubbery edging on the bottom keeps the unit from sliding. There's a MicroSD slot (labeled somewhat confusingly by its less-common name, \"TF card\"). A small red light indicates charge is in progress and turns off when charge is complete.[ A sample was provided to me for review. ]A reasonable choice if size is your primary constraint, and the build is solid.

The OXA Mini Bluetooth Speaker is a small but mighty, black plastic, squarish, lightweight (6 ounces) portable little  speaker that fits in the hand and puts out a clear, clean, audio spectrum with a reasonably good audible bass level. The cube-like device is readily identified on the Bluetooth screen of any transmitting device with which it pairs. The onboard Bluetooth mechanism paired with two generations of smartphones, and a MacBook Air computer. 2 blue LEDs on the bottom flash when sync is accomplished, as well as 3 audible tones. The rechargeable lithium ion battery lasts 4 to 5 hours. The side port allows a double-pronged audio cable to be connected between a non-Bluetooth device, such as an early generation Kindle, and the mini speaker, which disables Bluetooth when it is used this way. It takes about 4 hours to fully charge the speaker for use, although it comes already charged and ready for use out of the manufacturers box: just turn it on using the bottom switch.  The speaker has 4 onboard controls, but to use them requires the user to pick up the speaker and look at them in order to make an adjustment to raise or lower the volume, change tracks back and forth on the transmitting device itself. In testing, the mini speaker received the Bluetooth signal via an iPhone4 from up to 40 feet away, straight line-of-sight; also the unit was able to receive a clear music signal through the wall of an adjacent room transmitted by an iPhone, but this may vary due to local circumstances. The on/off switch is on the bottom of the speaker and be aware, the unit does not have auto-shut off. This is a great little portable speaker with big sound that can fill a room with music.

The OXA unit features ease of use, good battery performance, and reasonable sound quality. What distinguishes it from others is that it puts out a surprising amount of power without distortion.A full charge took around an hour and a half. Running time depends heavily on how it's used, but expect about 10 hours worst case and more in general. (Running in Bluetooth mode at high output obviously drains the battery faster.)The speaker is lightweight and highly portable, perhaps the lightest Bluetooth capable speaker of its type that I've tested thus far. The unit has its own on/off switch, volume and mode controls. You can figure these out on your own, or you can attempt to read the manual, which is in the smallest font I've ever seen. I couldn't read it even with a magnifying glass, although my wife, who has better eyesight, could read it with strong reading glasses. But even if you can read it you have to puzzle out the fractured English. I took someone's advice and scanned it, then enlarged and did some image sharpening to get a usable manual; if you own this device and want the image I can send it to you, or you can do it yourself.Bluetooth pairing is dead simple and took me about 30 seconds. If you don't want to use Bluetooth, though, the speaker will work in wired mode (cables supplied), or you can plug in a micro-TF card (which I don't have so couldn't test that part).The sound is very crisp and clear with a decent mid-range and satisfactory high end. There isn't much on the low end of the spectrum, but what there is, is clean. In fact, you can push this speaker to its full 3-watt output with minimal distortion. With a typical input source, it plays really loudly for its size. It won't fill Carnegie Hall, but it will deal with a medium sized conference room or outdoor patio with no problem, making it excellent as the \"speaker\" part of a speaker phone. (In Bluetooth mode, you can use it to answer the phone and talk on the phone, but I generally don't recommend this, as it's easy enough usually to just answer the phone normally.)Bottom line: it's versatile, easy to use, highly portable, very powerful, and the sound is decent.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to use and good sound for a small form factor", "unixReviewTime": 1397952000, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2014"}

For some, having a top-of-the-line, surround-sound listening experience is an all-consuming goal. While admirable if you can afford it, the standards of a small, portable Bluetooth speaker are definitely not as demanding. Now before you think that settling on the purchase of the OXA Mini Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (henceforth referred to as \"OXA PBS\") means that you are sacrificing audio quality, I can attest that, for the price you are investing in a speaker that will simply WOW you.Use & FunctionalityWhile I normally elaborate on the construction of the product that I am reviewing, in order to keep this simple I will only briefly mention some features. First, this speaker has some weight to it, and while it is not heavy, you can definitely tell that it is well-made. The base has a rubber gasket glued to it to prevent the speaker from sliding on and/or damaging a surface. A power button is on the base; when turned on blue lights appear indicating that the device is ready to go, and if no SD card is inserted into the slot on the top side, the speaker automatically enters pairing mode so that it can sync with the desired device.What separates the OXA PBS from other speakers in both the same price range and functionality are the different features that it has:1. It can sync with your cell phone, so that you can use it as a speakerphone and to answer incoming calls.2. As shown in the product pictures, it comes with an audio cable so that you can use it with a music device that may not have Bluetooth capability and/or link the OXA PBS to other speakers.3.  Has a micro-SD card slot to enable you to listen to audio files.4. With the buttons on the front, you can change songs and adjust the volume using the OXA PBS.5. The speaker is smart enough to raise the volume only in proportion to the volume setting on your MP3 player. For example, if I have the volume on my iPod set to low and I max out the volume on the speaker, it will still be only as loud as the iPod setting.OverallFrom the quality construction, ease of use, variety of options for use, and most importantly, the sound quality, the OXA PBS is a purchase that gives you the best \"boom\" for your buck! Being able to sync it to your phone, plug it into your laptop, or just use it as a way to have a way to listen to your music without headphones gives this Bluetooth speaker a whole lot of utility for a very reasonable price. The sound is clear and of good quality, the unit itself is durable and well-made, and with the included charging and audio cables, you have the ability to link your OXA PBS to everything from a computer on down to an old Sony Walkman.In short, the only thing that I feel that the OXA Mini Portable Bluetooth Speaker needs is a bag to carry both the speaker and cables. That is so trivial, though, as to be inconsequential. So, summing this all up, you cannot go wrong with this purchase! Excellent construction, sound, functionality, and versatility all make the OXA PBS indispensable!**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

They come in different shapes and sizes, but they all function in similar ways. They provide an improvement over the builtin speakers in your laptop or phone, and many of them also allow you to answer calls in a speakerphone capacity. With a flooded market for this sort of thing, how does the OXA model compare? Very favorably, it turns out!Some of these are just total rubbish: weak bass, muted highs, non-existent midrange, and low power. The OXA actually has a surprising amount of bass response. It&#8217;s nothing like you&#8217;d get from a regular sized speaker, but it&#8217;s very good for its size. The midrange is properly balanced so you don&#8217;t get certain frequency bands that jump out at you. The highs aren&#8217;t amazing, which may not be a problem for you depending upon the kind of music you listen to. I&#8217;ll elaborate:If you listen to music that primarily involves mids and highs, this isn&#8217;t your best choice. Acoustic music (jazz, folk, singer/songwriter stuff) sounds dull and lifeless. Conversely, if you enjoy rock or electronic music, the OXA really shines. I tried some trance music as well as some tech house and straight techno, and all sounded more lively, probably because the focus is on the bass and midrange. Really, it call comes down to knowing your listening habits.Realistically, a speaker this size isn&#8217;t going to sound great. That&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s about convenience. The OXA is small enough to toss into a backpack or laptop case, and it gives you a notably louder sound than whatever device you&#8217;re using it with.The main problem here is the manual. When you turn the speaker on, LEDs on the bottom of the speaker let you know the bluetooth status. It turns on and goes into pairing mode automatically, but if you want to switch the speaker to AUX mode and plug directly into your laptop or phone, it&#8217;s not clear how to do this. That&#8217;s where the manual comes in. It&#8217;s approximate one square inch in size (no exaggeration), but it&#8217;s filled with text, as if it were much larger. Imagine a regular book with regular-sized letters that had been shrunk into a one-inch square. It&#8217;s impossible to read without magnification. Since the speaker&#8217;s operation procedure isn&#8217;t completely intuitive, this is a problem. A tiny manual is fine, provided the text is large enough to read.Overall, this is a very good speaker considering its size. The manual is the main drawback.

On the side is a &#34;TF&#34; card slot that is the same thing as Micro SD, a charging port that is USB Mini-B (not to be confused with the newer Micro-B format), as well as next / previous song, play / pause and call buttons.The speaker automatically enters Bluetooth pair mode when it is turned on, and I had no problem pairing it with my notebook computer and my iPod. Once connected, you can control the volume either through your device or by holding down the &#34;Next Song&#34; or &#34;Previous Song&#34; buttons. You can listen to music and charge the battery using any USB plug, such as cell phone wall charger, car phone charger, computer etc.While sound quality and loudness are truly amazing, when connected via Bluetooth, it is much louder and richer when the speaker is connected via the supplied 3.5mm plug. I found this out at 4 this morning,while listening to a playlist on my iPod via Bluetooth. I decided to plug the speaker directly to the iPod and the volume instantly doubled and woke up my wife, who was sleeping at the other end of the house. That speaks volumes (pun intended) about the capability of this little thing.One of my two complaints is one that I almost always with OXA, and have mentioned it on more than one occasion to their reps... the user manual SUCKS. I don't know if there is such a thing as &#34;negative font size&#34;, but this manual contains the smallest print I've ever seen. I have 20/14 vision, meaning it's better than 20/20, and I can barely make out the words. OXA has assured me that they're working on revising the manual and their website.My second complaint is their choice of charging plug. USB Mini-B went out of style two years ago and was replaced by the more durable Micro-B USB plug. Luckily I still have a bunch of old cords from my Blackberry days, but this could pose an inconvenience to more than a few people.Besides those two minor issues, I absolutely love this speaker and had I paid the current price of $26 for mine, I'd be very happy with my purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleasantly Surprised by the Solid Construction and Great Sound of this Little Speaker", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}

This is the size I prefer to carry in my purse as it is not too big to carry with me yet big enough to provide more than just an emergency boost. It is 4\" long, 1.75\" wide, and 1\" thick. It weighs 4.7 oz. This battery pack has one port and comes with one 20\" charging cable. Not all cables are equal when used with Android devices, and this one performed very well (see tests below for details). The battery has a small on/off button on the side and it also has auto shut off. Four small blue LEDs on the top of the charger clearly show the level of the charge remaining in the battery. It has rounded form, and it looks nice and sleek.I tested AYL 6000mAh external battery pack with my Samsung Nexus phone, iPadMini, and Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet. For testing the tablets I used my own cables as the adapters for them were not included. I tested the Nexus phone with the cable that came with the battery as well as several of my own cables and AYL cable performed in line with my best charging cable and significantly faster than one of my data cables.If you are not interested in the details of the tests here is the summary of the results:The charger was very fast charging my phone. It charged both of my tablets but with below average speed. I was able to fully charge the phone twice.For those who are interested in the details of the tests I am including the details below.&#9733; How I tested this battery pack==================================I own a number of external batteries and to compare them I run the same set on tests on each of them, so they can be compared to each other using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased comparisons between different external batteries. For those who are interested in the details of the test I include at the end of this review.I use a USB current monitor and a charging test to test each port. The current monitor shows the voltage and the current flowing between the battery and the device.The amount of energy transferred from the charger to the device is calculated by multiplying voltage and current. Most of the chargers are 5V devices and most devices show the voltage very close to 5V. The interesting number is the current as it varies from unit to unit and from port to port.The current varies based on what the device requires and what battery provides. This communication happens using different protocols depending on OS. Newer Android OS versions have adapted their protocols to get better performance from ports aimed at Apple devices. An addition variable for Android devices is whether a data cable or charging cable is used to charge the device. The charging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see the cable as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source.The 10 minutes test consists of charging each mobile device on each port of the battery pack for 10 minutes and measure how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. Since the charging speed is non-linear I start charging each device from approximately the same charge level. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#9733; Test Results:======================&#10004; Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone--------------------------AC charging rate ----- 8% change in charge in 10 minutes (included cable)current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.04A and 5.03VAC charging rate ----- 8% change in charge in 10 minutes (my own charging cable)current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.03A and 5.03VUSB charging rate ----- 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (my own data cable)current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.42A and 5.04V&#10004; Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet--------------------------AC charging rate ----- 3% change in charge in 10 minutescurrent monitor: ~~~~~ 1.1A and 4.97V&#10004; iPadMini--------------------------AC charging rate ----- 1% change in charge in 10 minutescurrent monitor: ~~~~~ 0.92A and 5.06V&#9733; Summary------------------This pack showed very impressive performance with Nexus phone. It comes with an excellent charging cable.

It&#8217;s roughly the same dimensions (about 1.75 inches wide, 4 inches long and just shy of an inch thick at the thickest point) as a flip phone and the case is styled so that it looks like it would open up. However, it&#8217;s a powerbank rated at 6000mAh. Given that most powerbanks are so utilitarian looking, I&#8217;m impressed with the thought that went into this design.The powerbank has a single USB output port rated at 1A (located at the top) and a micro USB input port for recharging the powerbank (located on the side). It also has a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; indicator to show the power level left in the powerbank, and a pretty bright single LED flashlight (turns on with 2 quick pushes of the power button). The power button is small, but is raised enough so it&#8217;s easy to find by touch. It has a nice positive click when pressed.The overall build quality is excellent. It is all plastic, but the plastic is of good quality, and the seams are even and tight. All the edges are rounded, as is the overall shape from front to back, making it comfortable to hold and easy to fit into a pocket. It&#8217;s mostly a high gloss black with a smoky gray accent strip around the front. All in all, it looks quite nice.Operation is easy and straightforward &#8211; just connect the device you want to charge to the USB port and let it charge. The 6000mAh capacity and 1A output rating makes it more suitable for phones and small devices rather than tablets.It comes with a decent mesh pouch that is padded, and a micro USB cable. The instruction guide is brief but mostly well-written (which is a refreshing change from the usual situation).My only quibble is that the gloss finish is a fingerprint magnet. Normally I&#8217;d drop the rating due to that but, given how nice this looks, I&#8217;ll keep the rating at 5 stars.Nice build quality, good looks, and easy to use.

It really looks like a small cell phone more than it looks like a battery pack. It has a power button on the side and four little LED lights on the front that tell you when it's charging how much it has left to charge. They also illuminate when you are using it to power a device and will tell you how much charge is left on the battery pack. It comes with a USB cable that is used for charging it and can also be used to charge most cell phones. You need to charge an iPad or iPhone then you use the iPad or iPhone cable to connect to the battery pack. It has a built-in flashlight that can come in handy on occasion. I use it sometimes in my dark truck if I need to see something.The only downside that I have found so far is that it only has a single USB port so you can't charge more than one device at the same time. I have many other battery packs that all have at least two USB ports so I found that a little disappointing. The single USB port does output 2.1 amps so it's good for charging high powered devices like an iPad but it can be used for any device. The battery capacity is 6000 mAh which is almost enough to fully charge my iPad 2 but not quite. The newer iPads have a much larger battery so it wouldn't even come close to fully charging one of them. I could have used a little more battery capacity in my opinion. This battery pack is better suited for charging a cell phone or other smaller electronic devices. My Wife, Daughter, Son and myself all have our own iPad so extra battery capacity and extra USB ports are important to us.Overall I like the appearance of this battery pack and it works well but its usefullness is limited only having a single USB port and a smaller 6000 mAh battery.Sample provided for review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice looking and works well but only has a single USB port and only 6000 mAh capacity", "unixReviewTime": 1399680000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2014"}

Fowler", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "For someone who hasn&#8217;t owned a portable external battery pack, it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to know which one to pick.  For example, if you have simple charging needs and only need a boost now and then, some of the lipstick style, or smaller mAh battery packs will be just fine.  For example, the iPhone 5 has a 1,440mAh battery, while the iPad 3 has a huge 11,666mAh battery.  No way will the AYL 6000mAh fully charge the iPad 3, but could possibly give it a decent boost in an emergency.With the AYL 6000mAh battery pack you are realistically looking at a couple of full charges for your phone or, perhaps, a bit of a boost for a power-hungry devices.  If you know the battery needs for your phone and/or the devices you use on a regular basis, you&#8217;ll know what you want.  If you need portable power for an iPad, you should start looking at an external battery pack with a minimum of 10000mAh, perhaps more.I feel that the AYL 6000mAh is perfect for most people&#8217;s needs.  If you are an on-the-go person and need that extra power throughout the day, it&#8217;s ideal.  Simply making sure your battery pack is fully charged before you leave the house is a must.  You can either charge via your PC overnight or through an AC charger, a quicker option.The sleek look of the AYL with its beveled edges is quite appealing.  It fits in the palm of my hand, but if I want to travel with it, it can easily be tucked into its mesh travel pouch.  Of course black is a print magnet, but I think we&#8217;ve all come to expect that.  I tested it with my first generation iPad and was satisfied with the steady boost of power.No, it didn&#8217;t fully charge it, but I was assured with that steady performance, it would certainly give two or three full charges to a phone, depending on what size battery you have.  Simply check those specs out and chances are, the AYL will be something you could use.

The two main features that distinguish AYL from the competition are its relatively small size and its fun design that resembles a small flip phone.I&#8217;ve used the AYL 6000 mAh charger for a few days, and overall I am pretty impressed with it. 6000 mAh of charge capacity is enough to charge my iPhone two or three times, and to fully charge my first generation iPad 3G. This is a very light and well designed charger that easily fits into a compartment pocket of your messenger bag or a suitcase. In an emergency it can even fit inside of a larger pocket. It comes with a micro USB cable, which can be used for charging of various Android smartphones, Kindle book readers, or any other device that uses micro USB charging cables. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t come with Apple&#8217;s charging cables, so you will have to use your own or the ones bought from some other manufacturer. The micro USB cable can also be used to charge the AYL battery itself, but you will have to either rely on another charger or use your computer for this to work. AYL comes with a nice carrying bag, with pockets for both the battery and the cable.This is overall a pretty decent and nicely designed external battery, but it has its share of shortcomings compared to the other such chargers on the market right now. 6000 mAh is pretty much the low end of the capacity for such devices. Many of other external batteries come with Apple connector cables or attachments, as well as the ability to charge the battery independent of other devices. AYL, on the other hand, is very competitively priced, especially considering its more than decent quality. It is definitely a good product, but perhaps not the best one you can find right now.

Inside the box was the power bank, a Micro USB charging cable, an instruction manual and a carrying pouch all wrapped in a form fitting cardboard holder. It is a small power bank for its capacity.  About twice the size of the lipstick type power banks but more than double the capacity at 6000mAh.  It has a single 1 Amp USB charging port that was able to charge an iPhone 5S and an iPad Mini. It also has a built-in flashlight, which has good brightness. Overall, it seems to have a nice quality build.&#9830; Use and Performance - It came with some charge to it so I plugged it in and charged it until it was full. After it was full I did some testing. I took my iPhone 5S which had 49% charge remaining and plugged it into the charging port. I checked to see the progress periodically and found the following results:At after 10 minutes the charge increased to 60%.At after 20 minutes the charge increased to 69%.At after 30 minutes the charge increased to 80%.The speed results were great, and right in line with competing power banks with an average increase of 1% per minute. The overall capacity was great and had plenty of juice to charge my phone with plenty of capacity to spare.Conclusion:Overall, the AYL 6000mAh Power Bank performed great. It had a great capacity for such a small and sleek form factor.  I also gave it a try in my iPad Mini and it did fine charging it also, indicating that you are getting a full 1 Amp output from the port.

After watching the story about that highway-turned-parking lot, I finally understood the frightening ramifications of running out of power for my phone.  I finally realized that nature could very well supersede my planning skills and leave me (Yikes! Gasp!) alone and vulnerable and out of touch.  Yeah, it is definitely worth some heavy-duty thought!There are all kinds of battery chargers available:  You can find one the size of a business card, that fits in your wallet so you can make a few emergency phone calls.  And there are chunky chargers that can keep your phone going for days.  This 6000mAh falls in between those extremes and offers about a third of the charging capacity of the largest charger I've personally run across (a 15000mAh).  Only you can guess what your needs are--or would be--in a sticky, unexpected, situation.If you are looking for a very nice looking charger that will give you plenty of power to keep you running for many extra hours, and if you want it to fit in your pocket or small purse, this may be the one for you.To help in your decision-making, here is what this baby can give you:  With the power available in this charger (after about 6 hours charging time), you can add to your phone a little over 20 hours talk-time, or 25 hours web browsing or video/game-play, or 75 hours music-play.  On a tablet it is less:  Maybe a little more than 4 hours talk-time or web browsing, 15 hours music-play, or 5 hours video/game-play.And, not that beauty is a external charger's most important feature, but it sure does help, this one is definitely great-looking.  It is the size of one of your old-fashioned flip top phones.  It is of a size, with nice sloping curves, that fits nicely in the palm of your hand.  The one in my hand right now has a very shiny black body, with a very dark bronze frame.  It looks a bit different from the picture on the product page.  What amazes me, is that I would expect that \"very shiny\" would also mean a lot of finger prints.  But I have to say that no matter how hard I try to leave a finger print on this material, it will absolutely NOT take one.  (Okay, I admit I might be able to leave a print if I don't use a napkin while eating...)It has a four-LED-light power-level display, which give you a better heads-up than a two- or three-light display.It also has a flashlight!  Love the flashlight feature.  And it looks like many manufacturers are offering the flashlight advantage now, since it is such a popular feature.  (I'm just saying, don't end up with a charger without a flashlight...)Size-wise:  It is about 1 3/4\" x 4\" and weighs 4.7 ounces.Comes with a simple layered mesh bag that will help guard against normal daily wear and tear, but it does not provide padding to protect it if you drop it.  It also comes with a basic--and average--USB cord.If not used, it holds its charge for a long time.And here is a FYI that I picked up while investigating these external chargers:  It is advisable--if you only use this charger for emergency situations--to recharge it every few months in order to keep the battery working at peak performance.*I received a sample product from Accessorise.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What?

As this is the case, I always have certain things I am looking for in a good power bank: fast charging battery, easy to use and portability.The AYL 6000 mAh offers all of that, and a bonus flashlight option.The capacity, 6000 mAh is enough to charge an iPhone 5S 3-4 times. My Lumia 1020, 2-3 times. For most occasions, this is likely more than enough for most use cases. I can't seem to find out if this is a 2A or 1A charger, so be aware if you are using this to charge an iPad/tablet, it could take a lot longer to charge than you are accustomed to.Charge time from complete depletion is about 5.5 - 7 hours from my experience. Not bad.Do NOT charge the battery AND charge a device at the same time. Apparently this can affect the life of the battery cells in the power bank and is not recommended specifically in the manual.Before you buy, however, ensure it meets your needs. There are other power banks out there that offer higher capacity and/or ability to charge more than one device at a time. For me, this is easy to travel with and takes up a small amount of space. It isn't however, necessarily something you would want in your pockets. It's a bit on the &#34;fat and short&#34; side, over longer and skinnier, which doesn't lend well to being in the same pocket with your phone OR being in your back pocket, ready for use. If you carry a hand bag or man purse or whatever, it's definitely easy to carry along as it is fairly light though.In terms of price for what you are getting, I've seen and own less expensive options, though this is the only device I own that specifically calls out premium Samsung manufacturer battery cells, so I know this one will last quite some time and won't have capacity issues (not that the other devices I have had issues - it's just a peace of mind kind of thing).One thing I do hate about the AYL is the finish. If you want a fingerprint magnet, this power bank is perfect for you. I clean it frequently as I use lotion/hand cream frequently for my eczema. It's easy enough to clean though, so no big deal, just slightly annoying.The flashlight is a nice addition. It won't replace a MagLight, but if you want something that will help you see a keyhole at night, this is perfect.Overall, this is a great device, with the fingerprint caveat.I received a free sample from the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good power bank device", "unixReviewTime": 1391385600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2014"}

This case is a wonderful option! It comes in two pieces, and snaps on easily and removes easily as well, with the place to slip your fingernail into the bottom and pulling.Weight-wise, it only weighs 3 ounces - and while it WILL add weight and a bit of bulk to your phone, it is one of the lighter options I have tested. The holes for the speaker aren't problematic, and all of the buttons can be easily reached (and are not covered). The one adjustment you will have to make to your routine is that you need to add a dongle (included) to your plug in earbuds. This seems to be true on all of the battery cases.I like the textured feel of the case, but more importantly, I like the fact that it does NOT hold fingerprints! This keeps it looking professional.I don't usually watch videos on my phone, but I DO read, so the little stand is a nice addition. It pops out to a 90 degree angle, which places your phone at a 45 degree angle to the surface you place it on. The port for USB is a micro, and it charges both the battery and your iPhone. Best of all, it permits you to synch seamlessly with your computer without using the standard iPhone cord!I have given the case (without my iPhone in it) some rough treatment, and it holds up well.I received a complimentary sample of this item to test for a review, and am happy to report that it passed all of my tests with flying colors.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Practical, portable, and professional", "unixReviewTime": 1392595200, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2014"}

Schmidt", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "*Disclosure: I was contacted by a representative for Maxboost and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of giving my thoughts on it.*Battery life can make or break a mobile device.  The longer it lasts, the happy the owner is.  With devices such as an iPhone, which do not have a battery that can be swapped out easily by the consumer, battery life is all the more important.  To meet this need for juice, the industry responded with a wide variety of external batteries to give your phone/tablet an extra boot of power.  Later to market are items like this Maxboost Atomic S, which encases your iPhone instead of being a standalone product.  The thought here is that some owners will be willing to add a little girth to their iPhone in exchange for not having to plug into a charger as often.As with theuNu Aero Series iPhone 5S Battery CaseI previously reviewed, the tailored fit of the Atomic S is spot on.  Everything lined up correctly and the phone is snug inside the case.  The matte black plastic is of good quality, and ignores fingerprints in a way that a glossy material can never match.  The Atomic S is a bit bigger than the uNu, true, but it has a slightly higher capacity battery inside.  Also tossed to the wayside is the wireless charging function the higher priced uNu model has going for it.  While not a trade-off exactly, the Atomic S does have a kickstand/prop which the uNu model doesn't.  On the rear, the unit sports a series of muted color LEDS  for indicating battery life of the external pack.In operation, both models work the same, somewhat not-so-seamless way.  You have to manually enable the external battery for it to function at all.  Neither does this automatically, which is a bummer. When enabled, they will push their power reserve into your iPhone, keeping it alive and charging up the native battery at the same time.  When plugged into a charger, the iPhone's native battery gets charged first, then the external pack.  The external pack's charge level can only be manually checked by pressing the button on the back of the case.  Both charge and sync with your computer via micro USB instead of Apple's Lightening connector, which is a design decision I don't understand.  Why force the buyer over to a different cable standard?In three weeks worth of usage, the Atomic S functioned flawlessly and without fail.  The extended up time was a definite benefit, especially when the plugging in at night routine was forgotten.  Just hit the button and the phone was getting charged up.I believe the Atomic S to be a solid product, even with the kind of clunky manner in which it works.  It's not a fault in the design the makes it not so seamless, but rather Apple's rules for what manufacturers can and can't get access to in terms of the iPhone's hardware and software.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit.  The sampled I was sent has been given away to a friend, which is what I do with most samples, and she's been loving it.  Unless you really want the wireless charging option, and are willing to pay the premium for it, the Maxboost Atomic S is one of the best options available for the iPhone.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Feel thepower", "unixReviewTime": 1394928000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2014"}

At the core of this product is the battery, which is an impressive engineering feat because the manufacturer managed to achieve respectable power storage with very light weight.It at least doubles your use time by adding 2400 mAh to your phone's 1420 mAh. Even factoring in heat and other losses you increase your capacity twofold (or more) as soon as you charge it encase your phone. That alone is a powerful value proposition.The protection afforded by this case is basic. Don't get me wrong, it will protect your phone in controlled settings like offices. I do not view that as a detriment because this is designed to be a battery extender with collateral benefits of physical protection. The compromise is it does not add bulk or weight to your 5S.One final note: I first though the 'kickstand' was a gimmick to differentiate this from other battery packs. I have actually grown to love it because it allows me to easily view my phone's screen when I am working at my desk. A simple glance shows new events and notifications without craning my neck.

The stereo sound is good...it is strong, has a pretty clear quality, and though it necessarily depends upon a good connection...so to judge it, I played it off some beautiful recordings I have that deliver a nice range of sound, and I think the speaker does a pretty nice job...not very heavy on the bass sounds, and quite pleasant on the higher end of the scale.  This speaker box delivers pretty good sound for a stand-alone unit, a good, full-bodied sound for a small six inch cube sitting atop a table. I wouldn't use it in an auditorium, but in a normal sized room in a house it does just fine.I found it easy to connect through Bluetooth airwaves to my phone (though I could not get my Kindle HD Fire to recognize it). One can also connect it via your computer's USB port, OR connect your through a 3.5mm audio jack to a small port located at the top of the speaker cube, OR insert a TF card into the appropriate slot on the top of the unit. Through a touch screen that takes a little getting used to, you can move from \"Line\" use or Bluetooth or FM radio, and the unit, if unconnected, is powered by a battery that will hold a charge for about four hours.As for looks, the box is said to be a wood finish, though my box's black exterior didn't really seem very \"wood-ish.\" But I like the way it looks, regardless, and with two small exceptions I think the box is pretty nice: I'm not a big fan of putting the connectors ON TOP of the box, quite close to the front, as it clutters up an otherwise \"clean\" look.

Like almost every product I select to review, I wanted the Woody (OXA's name for this product) to succeed.  From the pics and spec sheet, it looks good.  In usage though, it becomes very apparent how thrown together this product really is.The Woody sports two side speakers and a third port up on top.  The built quality is pretty good, everything fitting together well.  The SD card, USB, Micro USB, and AUX connectors are a snug fit and functioned perfectly throughout my testing.  The unit that arrived at my door came with a dented speaker grill on top, but it wasn't horribly messed up.  The manual, as with all manuals that have come with every OXA product I've gotten, blows.  Not just because of the English and grammar, but also because of the size, lack of detail, and inaccuracies. (See their website for better manuals.)  Included in the box is everything one would need to get started.From here, we start finding the hokey stuff.  First thing one is supposed to do with a rechargeable device is charge it up.  The Woody is rated to provide 2+ hours of use time before the battery is depleted. This is way below the average for similar items, which are in the 8+ hour range.  The Woody doesn't particularly like to tell you when it's low on battery except when in Bluetooth mode.  In Bluetooth mode, a pleasant-ish voice announces that battery power is low and the battery indicator flashes.  In any other mode, the unit simply dies without warning.  When charging, the battery indicator and buttons are all illuminated.  Once charging is completed, the battery indicator turns off and the buttons do a slow fade in/out cycle.  In my use, charging from a 1A wall charger took about an hour or so.Bluetooth mode seems to be where all the attention was paid when the Woody was designed.  Besides the voice telling you when the battery is low, it also tells you when you've selected Bluetooth mode, when there is a Bluetooth connection, and when the Bluetooth connection is dropped.  The voice is not present in any other mode.  The controls all work fine across several apps including Pandora, but it should be noted that the Woody has its own volume control instead of controlling the volume on the volume on the device that is connected to it.  Audio quality and volume in Bluetooth mode varied between devices.  For example, the volume from the Nexus 7 was much lower and had less bass than the same track being sent from the HTC One, both with and without Beats audio being active on the HTC.  At volume level 6 of 32 on the Woody, nothing could be heard from the Nexus while the HTC could still be heard, (both were set to max Bluetooth volume).  Not having had this before with other devices of the same kind, my guess is that the circuitry in the Woody isn't smart enough to equalize input sources.  This is evidenced even more when other modes are selected.Playing back from storage, USB or Micro SD, the volume is substantially louder than the same track when played in Bluetooth mode. The loudest of all modes, according to the decibel metering app I was trying out.  The AUX is a close second.  The quality in USB and Micro SD modes is also superior to Bluetooth.  I can't tell with AUX.  In these two modes, the >> and &lt;&lt; buttons on the front panel have dual functions. Short press to jump tracks, as when in Bluetooth mode, but also long press which does in-track fast forward and rewind.  When using the function, the time marker for the track is displayed, allowing you to visually narrow down where you want to stop.  Sadly, neither mode makes use of the tags embedded in your MP3s.  Instead of scrolling the track/song title, you get the time of how long the track has been playing.  There are no playback modes, as in, repeat track, repeat all, etc.  No playlist support either.  Woody plays what he finds in order from first to last in a never ending loop.The last to be mentioned mode, FM, is perhaps the biggest let down of all the modes.  I thought it pretty clever that the Micro USB charging cable doubles as the antenna.  But, why on earth did they put all the ports up on top, where they are more susceptible to getting damaged?  Anyhow, in my area, reception was almost nil without the cable plugged in.  With the cable plugged in, I picked up 4 stations, three of which were playable and one that was just clear static.  Holding the end of the cable got me 28, with a few being pure static and some bleed overs. Ok, that stands to reason, a better antenna results in better reception.  But the algorithm used to determine which stations are ok coming in clear and which aren't is clearly flawed.  As the Woody has no method for manually selecting a frequency, that's a major problem.  That's right, with Woody you can only listen to the stations that it thinks comes in clearly during an initialization scan.  You can repeat the scan at any point if you want to play around with antenna position, but that also risks losing some of the other stations which may now be too fuzzy according to Woody.Some misc notes on Woody.  For best sound in terms of quality and rooms filling, put Woody in a corner or other recessed area so that the sounds from the side mounted speakers can bounce and project out.  There is a major difference in the level of bass when this is done, which is a good thing as Woody doesn't have much on his own.  Woody has a mind of his own at times.  If you're in, say, USB mode and plug in the AUX cable, Woody jumps modes to the utilize the new connection.  Remove the cable, and Woody jumps to FM mode.  Make a Bluetooth connection while in any other mode, and Woody ignores it, forcing you to manually select Bluetooth mode. Plug in an SD card or USB drive and Woody jumps to that mode.  Remove either, and Woody hops over to FM mode again.  Maybe.  Sometimes he goes to Bluetooth.As I see it, Woody's design was never fully thought out.  Yeah, some cool features, but feel very half baked and tossed together like a kid adding different decorations to their art project.  Not because the decorations made the picture better, but because they liked the decorations.  The inconsistent volume and quality is not desirable, or to me acceptable, for a device in this price range.  Other similar products have these things sorted out, why not Woody?", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Feature packed but haphazard design", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2014"}

The body is constructed of wood, which produces some good music. The face of the speaker is made of acrylic, which gives it nice look. In the hand is nice and light, but feel sturdy. The entire speaker is coated with a textured plastic that gives it a good feel. The size is similar to box of \"Kleenex\".The two pairing modes are Bluetooth or NFC (Near Field Communication). Bluetooth pairs the same as any other Bluetooth device. In order to use the NFC pairing mode, pass the back of your phone near the bottom right hand corner of the speaker screen. NFC pairing is a much faster way to pair than Bluetooth. When playing music the sound quality is great at lower volume levels, but becomes washed out at higher levels.There are three input options, this makes the speaker versatile. The first method is AUX, which allows the speaker to be used as a wired device with supplied 3.55mm cable. The Micro SD slot will play music from a memory card. The USB port is perfect for music stored on a \"Flash Drive\".The speaker has a FM Radio function, I was unsuccessful on using this function, and your mileage might vary. I know it say up to four hours of playback, I have only been able to get two hours. For a speaker this size with two big speakers, I was looking for playback time.

Newell \"Bob\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "This is a nice-looking, cube-shaped battery-powered speaker that has a wide variety of usage possibilities. I wouldn't call it briefcase portable, but you might take it along on a vacation trip by car. It's useful when you want more sound from a portable device and don't mind a little more size and weight (in return for better audio quality).It's really versatile, with several modes: bluetooth, line-in, USB or TF card, and FM radio. Yes, it has a built-in FM radio that works rather well on strong signals (heed the manufacturer's advice to connect the charging cable to act as an antenna). The radio has an automatic scanning function that you activate on first use or when changing geographical locations. The unit will remember the scanned stations between uses but unfortunately won't remember what station you last listened to, which is inconvenient.Line-in works with the attached standard 3.5mm TRS to TRS stereo cable, a widely used standard. You can connect to the headphone jack of most portable devices with no problem. By the way, the charging cable is USB to micro USB, another standard. It's always a plus when the manufacturer uses standard connections. (No charger is supplied.)Bluetooth is also available with a choice of conventional or NFC pairing. I found it paired very easily with no fuss. Sound quality (which I'll discuss further in a minute) seemed to take quite a hit, though, in Bluetooth mode. I think this had to do with the Bluetooth mode not being particularly sensitive, resulting in a relatively weak output. Line-in sounded a lot better.The volume output for reasonable input levels (1V RMS, more or less) is undistorted at max volume. Higher input levels cause distortion; that's to be expected. The maximum output of the unit is nice for a living room or patio, but not for a gymnasium ... it's a small speaker and works well within its design range.Sound quality? I had expected a little more, but again, it /is/ a small speaker. The best sound is in FM radio mode. Line-in is pretty close in quality. The high end is satisfactory, and the mids are clear and detailed. The bass lacks something but I guess I shouldn't expect to rock the walls with a small unit. Overall sound in FM and line-in mode is pleasant and easy to listen to. In Bluetooth mode I thought the sound had a &#34;thin&#34; quality.Other input possibilities include a USB drive and a TF card. Sound quality with these is about the same as line-in, which is pretty good. However, as with the radio, position information isn't saved (although that would be much more difficult with these types of input). Seeking is unguided (there is no track display) but this isn't supposed to be a substitute for a high-end MP3 player.The battery takes not quite 4 hours to charge for 90 minutes of play time. This is a major limitation. 90 minutes goes by in a hurry.The instructions are very brief, but if you can read the horrible English, they are surprisingly complete. Hiring a technical editor to fix the English wouldn't have cost much and would really have helped. But the device is easy enough to figure out with 15 minutes of experimentation.Overall evaluation: this speaker is very versatile, with an FM radio and multiple input modes. It's a fascinating gadget with a lot of uses and good sound for the size.

While not born there, it was the city where my love for all different types of music developed, even in the face of such horrible radio stations (the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame is a joke, but I digress). Back then I was proud of my tabletop stereo with the wired speakers as I rotated through my 3!! CD changer and grooved out. Now music lovers have the option of listening to music through Bluetooth wireless speakers, enabling us to play the sound wherever we like! Truly, technology is a marvel. And, of course, that is where the OXA NFC Bluetooth Natural [Wood] Wireless Speaker comes in.FunctionalityThe OXA NFC Bluetooth Natural Wood Wireless Speaker (henceforth referred to as the OXA NFC to save my hands from wearing out by just typing the product name) is a cube roughly the size of a large alarm clock; the nifty part is that you can use this speaker as an alarm by syncing it with a device that has one programmed. This, however, is but one function of this product.At it's heart, the OXA NFC is designed to play sound. Since it is a Bluetooth-enabled product that also happens to include a microphone built in to the top of the unit, there is a great deal of flexibility in how you choose to use this device. If you want it to act as a speakerphone for your cell phone/tablet, you can do that. Want to listen to music saved to a micro-SD memory card? No problem. Heck, it can even support devices that do not have Bluetooth capability by using either a USB or 3.5mm Aux Line-In (the cable is even included in the box).What if you don't have a music device? Never despair: if your pet iguana ate your iPod, this device can even function as an FM radio to help you get through the day(s) until you can get a replacement (or until the iguana gives it back to you, if you know what I mean)!Use/PerformanceWhen you first turn on the OXA NFC, it will automatically enter Bluetooth sync mode; during this time you can have your iPod (or other device) detect the speaker in order to link. Once you have set up a connection to the speaker, the next time that you use it in Bluetooth mode it will connect to the same iPod within the first few seconds after the speaker is turned on, automatically.When using the OXA NFC, the screen on the front of the device will say \"Blue\" and a voice will advise you when the speaker is connected to your device; command buttons will then appear at the bottom of the screen (it is a touch screen), allowing you to adjust the volume, choose a song, play/pause, and choose the operation mode. With the Bluetooth mode being the first mode, the second is the FM radio, third is Line-In, and finally back to the same voice announcing that you are in Bluetooth mode.Pros:1) Syncing this speaker to your desired Bluetooth-enabled device is a breeze. No fussing around and holding down buttons for a set period of time; the OXA NFC takes care of that for you.2) The sound quality of this unit is amazing; especially considering how lightweight it is!3) The \"Mode\" button responds quickly and cycles between modes with no issue.4) If you have an audio device plugged into the OXA NFC before you turn it on (i.e. - auxiliary cables and/or the micro-SD card reader), when you do use it, the speaker will detect that device and enter the appropriate mode.5) The volume level is independent of the music device synced to the speaker. While the volume will go up if you raise it through the device, the speaker will respond. However; you can then use the command buttons on the face of the speaker and bump it up/down as desired.Cons:1) While you can change the song playing on your iPod/music player through the control buttons on the touch screen, there seems to be a bit of a lag when doing so. In the long run it is much faster to change songs using your iPod, rather than the speaker.2) The battery takes about four hours to fully charge, and then only lasts roughly 1-1 hours before you need to charge it again.3) While the speaker is of good quality in the design, dropping the OXA NFC would most likely prove disastrous, especially on a hard surface.4) While you can go into FM radio mode wirelessly, you will drain the battery VERY quickly. You must have it plugged in to get the best results.5) The OXA NFC works well as a speakerphone, but the microphone has a tendency to pick up smaller background noises.6) The display screen will always list the mode that the speaker is in, which is great, but I really wish that it would show either the current song title/artist information, or even more basic, a clock, as the default.OverallWhile I think that the sound quality and the bevy of features that are available with the OXA NFC Bluetooth Natural Wood Speaker are great, with the short battery life it is a stretch to justify the cost. Sure, you can keep it plugged in, but that rather defeats the purpose of having a Bluetooth speaker in the first place. If OXA can improve the rechargeable battery's life so that you can use the unit wirelessly for longer than an hour, then I could see paying $40 for this item. Otherwise I would hold off and/or invest in one of the smaller Bluetooth speakers that OXA offers (I have one and LOVE it).**Disclaimer: This speaker was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

The other bonus feature, that I haven't yet seen included in other speakers of this type, is FM radio capability. This means that if you want to save your phone's battery, but still have music and don't mind the radio, the OXA speaker will work wonders for you.Another feature, a highly welcomed feature for someone who doesn't think of the things they buy as throw away items, is the inclusion of a removable and replaceable rechargeable battery. The benefits here are two fold. First, when the battery stops holding a charge, you can replace it (in theory - I'm not sure if they sell replacement batteries). The second is that you can also carry a spare battery for the instances where the 6-8 hours of play time just isn't enough. I can't personally think of any situation where I'd need more than 6 hours of music straight, but the nice thing is that it is here if I need it.In terms of sound quality, I am rarely impressed by the sound coming from a Bluetooth speaker. This speaker is not really any different in that regard, despite including two actual speakers. The mids and highs are nice, but the low end bass isn't quite what you'd expect from something this size. That being said, compared to similar BT speakers, the sound is no WORSE, and that's good. With the user replaceable battery, the ability to use micro SD and wired connections for playback, along with a decent display, this speaker deserves 5 stars for offering something above and beyond what has become status quo for these speakers.The design is pretty and a little soft spoken. It isn't ugly, it isn't drop dead gorgeous - it's pretty enough to not be distracting.The only complaint you might have, and you should be aware before buying, is that this speaker isn't really a travel speaker. This would be a great device to have in the kitchen or living room when you just want music but don't want to run cords or have a large receiver. Heck, it can even serve it's purpose when you have all that equipment and just don't want to fire it all up.Overall, this is a nicely designed, good sounding BT speaker with some nice added features.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1393718400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2014"}

The first time the unit is in radio mode, it does a search to locate the FM stations available in the area, and stores them in memory.The controls are rather unique, as the cube shaped unit has a display panel with red LED's that displays the mode, or radio station frequency.  Six touch sensitive \"buttons\" are used to adjust the volume, select the mode, tune in radio stations, and perform other functions.  The buttons are rather small, but seem to work fairly well.The OXA has two 2\" diameter speakers, which deliver pretty good sound quality, although there can be some distortion at higher volumes.  With such small speakers, this unit isn't intended for a huge space, but they do a nice job in a smaller area.  The speakers face in opposite directions and direct the sound out the sides of the unit, rather than straight ahead, so you do get a less direct sound.  Although there are no provisions for adjusting the tone, the speakers handle most kinds of music well, and really sound solid when listening to podcasts.Bluetooth pairing is simple, and the unit is also capable of playing audio from other sources, via an auxiliary in jack, a USB port, and a slot for a micro-USB card.  The line in function worked fine, as does the USB port.  When playing MP3's stored on a flash drive, while you can fast forward through a track, there does not appear to be a way to skip tracks, or navigate the files on the media.  This is not at all convenient.  I attempted to play files stored on a micro-SD card, but the device did not recognize the card.Accessories include a twin male audio cord, and a USB cord with a mini-USB connector for charging the unit.  There is a battery symbol on the display panel, but mine many not be working properly, as no matter how long it is plugged in, it never shows up as being fully charged.  The stated battery life of about two hours, isn't that impressive.The \"manual\" consists of information printed on a scrap of paper, slightly larger than a 3x5 card.  There's not a lot of detailed information, and the grammar isn't the greatest.  This is typical for the OXA products I have seen, and I recommend that the company make an effort to make some improvements in this department.  While you can figure out most of what you need to know about these speakers by trial and error, more detailed information and instructions, would have been helpful.The OXA NFC is nicely made, and the \"wood design\" looks quite attractive.  The unit has a small footprint, audio quality is rich and warm, the controls that are kind of fun to play with, and the FM radio is a nice bonus.  OXA seems to have a progressive approach, and while I really do appreciate some of the innovative features, there are some deficiencies with this unit, that keep it from earning 5 stars.  If you're looking for a small Bluetooth speaker, this one is worth a look, as besides the features I have outlined, the price is competitive, it comes in several colors, and it is backed by a one year guarantee.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "a bluetooth speaker, with an FM radio...", "unixReviewTime": 1392681600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2014"}

The LCD's viewing angle, which I complained about in the Pulse, has also been fixed.  I can read it clearly when looking directly at it.  One complaint though is that when the unit is in a cool or cold environment, artifacts appear on the LCD until it warms up a bit.  ~20-30 seconds when the ambient temperature is around 60F.

I know it's overkill, but I always keep at least two external backup batteries in my briefcase at all times. These things have saved me from being powerless so many times. I've tried many different brands and capacities--all different types and sizes, so I have a lot of experience with these devices.Most of these chargers are a commodity. They hold a charge. They have a USB port or two. They do their thing. *Yawn*. That's all there is to it.This one is interesting though. At first it looked a little gimmicky and I thought I wasn't going to be impressed, but I WAS WRONG!The huge difference between this power block and it's competitors is the digital display. Some of the other chargers I own have no power indicator and some have blinking dots. This one actually has a digital display that gives you all sorts of info. At first I was having trouble reading it and thought it was really strange. I plugged it into the wall and it read %001 charge, which seemed odd. And none of the other indicators that were listed in the documentation came on, which bugged me. Then I realized that I'm a moron and was reading the display upside down. It was really charged 100%, which meant that none of the other indicators should have been on anyway. Oops.I plugged in my iPhone 5, which was down to about 15% discharged. I kept an eye on it while I puttered around the kitchen. By the time I had the kitchen clean and the dishes washed, my iPhone was fully charged and the Maxboost was only down to 96% charge. I'm no math wiz, but I think that means I can get at least three or four charges for my iPhone from this, right? ;)It's really nice that the display shows the rate of charge or discharge too. While charging my iPhone, it showed that it was discharging at 2.1A, so it was easy for me to see whether I had plugged it into the wrong USB port or not. Very cool.You can probably tell that I'm a geek about these chargers. It seems like we've all become so dependent on our gadgets, so it's really a shame when they run out of juice.

As a rule I haven&#8217;t been enamored with battery packs that feature a digital display.  Everyone always seemed to love them except for me and the reason being was that they seemed to drop way too much charge when initializing.  The manufacturers claimed that, more or less, it was standard procedure.  Frankly, I never bought into that theory.I still don&#8217;t buy into that theory because I think that it&#8217;s a faulty one simply made up to justify a poor performance.  The Maxboost Electron+ only dropped 5% of it&#8217;s charge and boosted my iPad&#8217;s by 14% in thirty minutes.  Initially it seems a tad slow, but then steadily moved along.  I usually use a first generation iPad to test all my battery packs to provide consistency.My informal testing says a lot and what is says is that the Maxboost Electron+ is a dependable battery pack that is a performer.  It will do what you want when you want it to.  There are a lot of decent battery packs out on the market now and manufacturers are stepping up to the plate to provide top notch ones.

I was quite pleased as I watched it&#8217;s steady push as it totally charged my iPad.  My 10000mAh Maxboost did a great job, but the 15000mAh did as well, but left me assured that if I really needed the battery pack, the power would be in my hands.  I&#8217;m particularly thinking of the airport scenario where there are plug hogs.  Sometimes it&#8217;s pretty tough to find an available receptacle to use for charging.Initially I misread the specs on the back of the Maxboost Electron+ and thought I was dealing with a 12000mAh battery pack.  I was quite amazed that the incremental power drops were so small.  With 68% of the Electon&#8217;s charge left I could charge that iPad all over again.

And I made the comment &#34;If you are not going to see a wall or car outlet for a &#34;scary&#34; long while, this is a great charger to have tucked away.&#34;  Then that winter storm hit more than half of the U.S. and I watched--like most of us did--the Atlanta, GA highway system turn into a parking lot!  &#34;Scary long time&#34; took on new meaning--at least for me it did!  I sat watching the TV screen and imagining some heroic person walking down the highway handing out fully charged Maxboost chargers...  After seeing those poor people stuck on that Georgia highway, I'll never under-estimate the potential for nature--or whatever unknown--to keep me away from a power source!My point is, whether you know in advance you are not going to see an outlet for a long while or you are just considering an external battery charger for &#34;piece of mind&#34;, you might as well get the largest capacity battery, and the most user-friendly battery charger, that you can. This one has the superior charging power you need!I know there are a multitude of chargers available: There are chargers available that are only the size of a business card and fit in your wallet that will allow you to make a call or two in a dire emergency, and there is this &#34;Plus&#34;.  Of course, there are hundreds of external chargers out there for every type of situation in between these two.Only you can decide where your own comfort level is.  You can tempt fate and just plan for a minor inconvenience or you can buy this one and rest easy. But if you think you will need to re-charge your phone and your tablet more than once before you see a charging source, or if you only have a phone and you will want to re-charge it up to ten times before finding a normal charging source--you should consider this charger.This is not a charger for the pocket of your jeans or your evening bag.

(The bag is a bit small for the bigger charger.)Except for its bigger charging capacity, this charger is much like its smaller predecessor:  Both have outstanding charging capabilities.  Besides that major and most important fact:--I have never seen a better user manual: It is very well-written and explains everything and provides accurate pictures. It assumes that you have never used an external charger before. I am very impressed with the simple, little manual. I wish all manuals worked so well.--It has a digital read-out that clues you in to exactly what it is charging at the moment and how much charge power is left. There is no ambiguity, no guesswork at all.--It has a flashlight! I always carry a small flashlight with me.

Well, it's 15000 mAh, so of course it's a third more power. The size is a bit bigger, but not that much. It is heavier, as you'd expect, but solidly made. Both the Pulse and this new Electron Plus have very similar features, and are easy to use. The price is higher for the Pulse, but if you compare the cost for a 10000 vs. 15000 mAh charger, it's adjusted accordingly. You may want more of a backup than the smaller charge gives for heavier use and recharging.Now that many newer Android smartphones follow the iPhone route and close off a battery compartment, external chargers appear to be gaining in necessity. This Maxboost 15000 mAh Dual-port 3A Premium USB Portable External Battery differs from other chargers, in my experience, five ways.1) It's heftier. Near a pound, perhaps. It's more rugged, on the other hand, as a trade-off. Likely too heavy for a pocket, but in a pouch, backpack or luggage, a better fit.2) It's readable. The blue LED as the product description displays above makes this more precise in its readout in bigger black letters on a brighter blue background. This allows more precision as to estimating (the claim is to 1%) how much or how little of a charge is needed.3) It's laid out thoughtfully. The added flashlight button is easily turned on (and &#34;off&#34; needs as the helpful instructions remind you, just an added push for a short time) as an added bonus. It's easy to hold in the hand with its curved shape rather than a brick like other chargers, and so it fits well into the palm.4) Mini-USB and an Apple-compatible plug are provided as options and a small case is also sent along, a thoughtful touch. Finally, the dual ports for 2.1 tablet or 1 phone are engraved with their respective entries. This may be harder to make out in the dark as it's black on black, but it does not wear away easily.5) The box for the Electron in its list of items it can charge updates some of the newer smartphones and devices but it's compatible with pretty much the gamut of phones, tablets, MP3 players, and iPods and iPads--and even Google Glass.

At 15000 mAh it has over ten times the capacity of a stock iPhone 4 or 5 series, which are  rated at 1420 mAh. It comes in at just under five times the 3200 mAh capacity of my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and exceeds by about forty percent the capacity of a fourth generation iPad's 11,560 mAh battery. In other words, this has impressive storage and charging capabilities.It has a micro USB port input for charging the unit itself. It's nestled between the two USB out ports and can be a tight fit depending on which cables out you are using. For charging, though, you can use the cable that is provided or your own. The two USB out ports are at different levels. One is rated at 1A and the other is 2.1A and can be used simultaneously. It also ships with an adapter cable with mini and micro USB ends, as well as an Apple 30 pin connector.Note: I have found that this works best when you do not attempt to charge the unit while it's powering other devices. I did use this to power my Galaxy Note 3 and a bluetooth speaker for music and still had sixty-five percent remaining capacity (according to the LED display) twelve hours later. That is impressive to me. In fact I love the large blue lit display that shows the percent remaining power. That feature sets this apart from the myriad of other battery packs I have tested in the past (except the smaller sibling of this model.) For me it's a convenience, but for folks who are emergency responders or who are preparing for an emergency this feature is critical.This also comes with a built-in flashlight that is not particularly powerful, butt makes this perfect for emergencies. It is a bit large and heavy at 4.25 x 2.8 x .8 inches and 8.2 ounces.One final note: if you discharge this pack down to five to ten percent remaining charge it can take up to twelve hours to charge it back up using a standard wall charger. Considering the capacity that is not an unreasonable amount of time. This will probably not charge via a computer USB port - just had to see and after two hours mine did not increase by a percent.Bottom line: compared to its sibling this model gives the most bang for your buck. More importantly, it is a definite value when compared to most other competing models on the market.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible capacity and perfect for emergency use", "unixReviewTime": 1391126400, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2014"}

And \"Maximized\" is the correct word for this 15,000 mAh Maxboost Electron Plus Portable Battery charging 'monster' that has so much power it can simultaneously charge 2 devices (a tablet via the 5 volt, 2.1 mAh USB port and a iPhone5 via the 5 volt, 1.0 mAh USB port, for example) through its dual charging ports, plus it has an onboard LCD screen which gives an exact numeric readout of the percentage of power remaining and the active ports in use. And with the remaining power it can charge 2 iPhones. The physical dimensions and weight are: 5 inches by 3 inches by 1 inch, 10.9 ounces. After extensive testing and re-charging, this battery charger is one of the two best large capacity device chargers among the number of electronic battery chargers I have tested in recent months, both by Maxboost.During the test, the Maxboost Electron + charged an iPhone5 in 1 hour and 54 minutes while simultaneously charging a Kindle Touch in 3 hrs and 50 minutes, with 67% of MaxBoost Pulse capacity remaining, which could have charged an iPhone or similar device at least three times. At the beginning of the test, the iPhone 5 was up for use in 6 minutes, while the Kindle Touch was up for use in 18 minutes. In my universe, it charges iPhones, iPods, Kindle tablets, and small computers, and with its LCD screen gives the user a constant display of how much power remains during the process.In my testing, it charged at a faster rate up to the 50% point before dropping back to a more normal rate nearing the 100% level of charging: a characteristic shared by both Maxboost batteries. This gets the user's device 'up and running and in the green status' on the device's `% meter' faster than chargers I have tested which usually charge at a 1% per minute rate (for example this Pulse charger pushed the iPhone to a 25% charge level in 20 minutes). The Electron Plus charger itself re-charges to full capacity via the 5 volt micro USB input port in around 12 and a half hours if plugged directly into the wall and using the correct power cord; using an extension cord slows down the charging speed of the MaxBoost Pulse charger considerably. Plus the Maxboost Pulse has a nice 'close-in use' emergency light on the side, good for hours of use. In any household with many small electronic gadgets, this would be an excellent charger that can do \"two devices at a time\" and then have capacity to charge another item.

This charger is NOT what I would call portable in the sense that you would want it in a purse or hand bag or, even worse, a pocket. It is, by all measures &#34;massive&#34; in size (a given due to the capacity).As long as you know you aren't getting something easily pocketable and don't mind, then what you get with this battery is massive capacity, dual device charging capability, premium Samsung battery cells and a great LCD display so you know exactly what percentage of the charge is available. The last part, the LCD display, shouldn't be discounted as a silly feature. When you press the power button, the display lights up and indicates exactly how much power is left via a percentage. This is superior to how just about every other power bank works, as most others offer a set of lights that you just to guess is 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% or 75-100%. You will know exactly when you should be plugging this into the wall.There are two charging ports, which can be used simultaneously to charge devices. Again, this shouldn't be taken lightly as the ability to charge more than one device can be quite a boon in today's digital age. One is a 2A the other is a 1A port. The 2A should be used for tablets and phones designed to use the 2A speed, while the 1A should be used for phones and other devices (and it should be noted, you can still charge a tablet on the 1A port, it just takes longer to charge the tablet).The flashlight is fairly bright, but won't replace a MagLite. In an emergency, it can be a nice to have, but since the device isn't the most portable, I'm not sure of the actual utility of such an option - more than likely you won't be running around town with this in your pocket.Keep in mind this is heavy. The capacity dictates quite a large battery cell be included, and battery cells add weight obviously.At 15000 mAh, you can get one full charge on an iPad, or up to TEN charges of an iPhone 5S (assuming 100% efficiency and so on - most likely you would be looking at 8 or 9 full charges). Depending on your use case, this could be a life saver.Overall, I am quite happy with this power bank.

In my way of thinking, you can never have too many external battery packs. As a friend is fond of quoting: &#34;ABC - Always Be Charging&#34;. While there are a few things that I could put down as &#34;disadvantages&#34; to the Maxboost, it keeps coming back to one thing for me... this battery has some serious power reserves. I could go out into the desert for a week with my iPhone and this battery, and I wouldn't care if I never found an outlet until I returned.At 15000mAh, this is the largest battery pack I own. It's got a bit of heft to it, such that you wouldn't forget you had it in your pocket or purse. But if you had it in a go-pack or backpack when you're going through your day, it'd be fine. It comes with two output ports at 1.0A and 2.1A. Technically, you could charge two phones or a phone and a tablet at the same time. The input to the unit for recharging comes from a normal micro USB cord. The storage bag (black velvet) comes with the USB cord and adapter plugs for micro USB, mini USB, and the 30-pin Apple connector. If you needed a lightning connector for an Apple device, you'd have to bring your own. Finally, there's a built-in flashlight that turns on when you click the power button twice. You may never need it, but it's there.In terms of recharging speed... When charging my iPhone 4, I was getting more than 1% of recharge per minute, which is my general measuring standard. When done charging, I found that I had only gone through 9 - 10% of the battery reserve. I could easily get seven or eight iPhone recharges on this battery! Charging my iPad was more of a strain on the unit, and it was taking about an hour for each 10% of charge. If my iPad was completely drained, I'd look at the battery to give me one recharge. I'd probably do better to plug in the battery while I use the iPad, and let it slow down the rate of iPad battery drain so I get more usage time instead of waiting half a day to get a fully repowered iPad.On the battery charging times... It took most of the day to take the battery unit back up to 100% capacity. It didn't seem to matter whether I had it plugged into a USB port or into a power plug adapter. It's definitely not fast, and it seems to slow down the closer you get to 100%. I would plan on recharging it overnight when you don't think you'll be needing it. Slow? Yes... but the amount of power it gives me when it *is* completely charged makes that an OK tradeoff for me.You could get REAL picky and say that the black glossy cover on the unit attracts fingerprints way too easily. I say that's what shirts are for... to wipe off fingerprints. I can't get overly excited or bothered over smudges when compared to what the battery can actually do (which is lots!)If I wasn't so enamoured over the amount of backup power and number of recharges I get with the Maxboost, I *might* consider making this a four-star rating.

That's what the uNu Enerpak Maximum is for - feeding those devices.  A solid glossy brick of a unit, the Enerpak stores a tremendous about of power, the output of which is only limited by the number of USB ports it has.  It sports an LED flashlight on one of the sides, which is fairly ok in full dark, but not something I'd want to use except in a pinch.  As common with these gloss surfaced items, it picks up fingerprints, scuffs, and scratches quickly.  That's especially note worthy if you plan to keep this unit in the glovebox or door pocket of your car.  Alonf the top surface is a blue LED indicator strip for telling how much of a charge the unit still has.  While it's very useful in its own right, this design is a little off from other models in that the indicator turns off even when the unit is in use.  That threw me off a bit initially, as I have learned to rely on the indicators letting me know when something is plugged in.  Speaking of plugging in, the Enerpak has auto-detection built in, meaning that as soon as you plug something into it, the power starts flowing.  This is one of my favorite features of external packs, doing away with the power on/off button.  Besides the list of devices above, I tested the unit with a plethora of other USB charged items.  Speakers, headsets, watches, lights, cameras, etc.  Each and every use was flawless, and devices charged as quickly as if being plugged into a wall outlet.  The uNu did away with the typical generic cable with different tips that could be swapped for using the Enerpak with different devices.  I can't say that I blame them, as I prefer using my own cables anyhow.In the two weeks that I have been using the unit, other than the LED indicator turning off while the unit is in use, I can't find a flaw in it other than the price.

When you are sitting stuck on a highway and have to decide between charging your device and keeping your car's battery charged enough to keep the heater going, the decision will not be hard to make: You will save your car's battery, and hopefully you will have enough charge in your device to make one emergency call home.So, I solved my particular potential dilemma by stowing a large, dependable external battery in the consoles of my vehicles. Your situation may be totally different. But if you take road trips, spend a lot of time in planes and airports, or spend weekends out in the wilderness, then you need to have backup battery power for your devices.This is the largest battery that I own.

That's it.The booklet is brief but well-written and informative. The device fits in the hand, enhanced slightly by its one beveled edge, and is not too big or too heavy.

I will focus on my own experience for some specific uses as well as general impressions.I test a lot of these battery packs and this one stands out for both looks and performance. Performance is what counts and this pack is right up there with the newest ones on the market. Capacity is is key and the review sample I received had that. While there are a few models that have more capacity, the 17000mAh is up there and is why I love this pack. If you are non technical that number is probably meaningless, so let me put it into context. The following devices come with stock batteries with capacities and use times as follow:* Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.* Apple iPhone 4S 1440mAh battery with about 6 hours of use time.* Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.* Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.* Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.Using the above numbers this pack will extend, for example, an iPhone 5S' battery capacity by a factor of ten (although with charging and heat losses it's closer to the 700 to 800 percent range.) The net increase in use time goes from 8 to about sixty hours. Doing the math on the other devices cited above yield equally impressive results.I mentioned looks. This pack reminds me of an onyx pen stand that I owned years ago - solid, gleaming black and beautiful. It looks great on a desk, which is where it belongs because at over ten ounces this is not exactly sometime you normally carry in a pocket or purse. It has a convenient night light, which is a feature I do not see myself using since mine is a permanent fixture on my desk. However, this makes a great emergency power supply for folks who camp or hike, so if you do not mind the weight you will have a margin of extra power, plus an emergence light.Bottom line: if you are using power-hungry devices like an iPhone 5S or Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, this battery is worth every penny.

This black, sleek uNu Enerpak Maximum 17000 mAh external battery charger is a 'power monster' providing high-storage capacity simultaneous power charging for both those listed electronic tablets on the Amazon product page  such as iPads via a 5 volt, 2.1 amp port, and those listed smartphones on the Amazon product page via a 5 volt, 1 amp port.

I've powered up all of the chargeable digital items that I own with this charger and it still has quite a bit of reserve power left. For example, I charged an iPhone and a Tablet simultaneously and there are still 3 out of the 4 status lights burning. The only minor complaint is that while the iPhone5 charged up at a very speedy 1 hour and 55 minutes via the I amp port (which is slightly faster than charging directly from the wall socket-1 hour: 57 minutes), it took 5.5 hours to charge up the tablet to full capacity via the 2.1 amp port. The tablet, however, initially powered up faster than the iPhone and was available for use in a quick 2 1/2 minutes versus 3 minutes for the iPhone5. But, it took 15 hours to charge up the uNu Enerpak 17000 to 4 steady status lights, but that is understandable due to it's great milliampere-hour capacity.

It's a great battery...In this particular usage scenario, I used the battery to recharge my iPhone 5S at the end of each day. Over the course of five days, I ended up running the equivalent of 3 full charges before it finally went from 4 LEDs to 3 LEDs on the power indicator. I then used it to recharge and run my Kindle for four more days, and I *finally* ran it down to a single LED. I know that a 17000mAh battery pack has a lot of juice, but this went longer than what the specs led me to expect.The design of the device is solid. It's a black high-gloss coating with the on/off control running down the length of the unit. There's an LED flashlight which is a nice-to-have in a battery pack. The input port is next to the on/off switch, and the two output ports (5V/1A and 5V/2A ports) are situated at each end. The labeling is embossed into the case, but it's a little hard to read (black on black).

It's pretty compact considering it has a 12000mAh capacity, measuring roughly 3 inches wide and six inches tall. It's about 5/8 inches thick. The size, plus the fact that it weighs 11.1 ounces, makes this rather large for carrying in a pocket. However, it slips into a tablet carry case without a problem. Given that the capacity is something best suited to a tablet, I don't find the size at all objectionable.The case feels metal-like, but it is plastic. The build quality is excellent - it feels solid, and the case has a matte finish that looks good and hides fingerprints perfectly. It has a rounded profile making it easy to put into, and pull out of, a laptop or tablet bag without it getting snagged on anything.All the ports are at the top end. There are two USB output ports (one is 1A; one is 2.1A), a micro USB input port for charging, and a LED flashlight. It has the usual LED \"gas gauge\" to show the power level left. The LED indicators are blue, easily seen, but don't blind you like other indicators I've seen. The on/off button is on the side, sticks out enough so it can be easily found, and has a positive click so you know the press has been registered.My only quibble is that the port output ratings are sliver on sliver, making them hard to read. Black text would have been a better approach.Zero complaints with performance.It's a good choice if you're looking for a large capacity powerbank that has a slim (for the capacity) profile and solid build quality.

In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's large, effective, versatile and well designed. It's one of the largest external battery that I've come across in terms of capacity (with whopping 12,000 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than some of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S,iPhone 3G,Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Paperwhite,Mobee Magic Bar,Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generationiPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged Onite battery. I was also able to charge my iPad completely, and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around. If there was an easy way of connecting this battery to an ultrabook I would not be surprised if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as well.The battery comes with an AC charger, micro USB cable, iPhone 30-pin adapter and an Apple lightning adapter. The inclusion of iPhone adapter is very convenient for those of us in the iOS land - most manufacturers of these batteries just assume that we'll bring our own cables.This Onite battery is also beautifully designed. You would not be ashamed of being spotted with this battery at a trendy tech conference. The battery is very easy to use and operate, and overall vey intuitively designed.I am very pleased and impressed with this rechargeable external battery. It is effective, portable, and very affordable. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot or uses their gadgets on the go all the time.

What sets this one apart is the price, which at thirty bucks at the time of this review is a bargain, and capacity. I put the review sample I received through its paces and it passed all of the test points I normally check.First, the battery itself charges in about twelve hours, which is fairly quick for one at this capacity.  Second, it fast charged both my Galaxy Note 3 phone and my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 simultaneously. The Note 3 is not much of a challenge, but the Tab 3 is on the power hungry side and is slow to charge off of anything other than the wall charger it shipped with. So that alone won me over and inspired me to give it five stars.The form factor is on the large side, but as a desk charger it is not an issue. I would not recommend lugging it around in a purse or pocket. I love the aluminum exterior which is not only attractive, but serves a purpose.As for capacity, I always multiply the claimed capacity by .9 because batteries lose some in the charging process, as well as being affected by temperature, the age of the battery itself and even the cable you use. Using my formula I am approximating the effective capacity of this out of the box to be 10800 mAh, which is still enough capacity to charge an iPhone 5S with its internal 1440mAh battery 7.5 times.It's also more than 3 times the capacity of my Note 3's 3300mAh battery, and slightly over 90% of the capacity of an iPad 2's 11,560mAh battery and 1.5 times the capacity of the 6800mAh battery in my Samsung Tab 3.The above boosts in the use time of the devices I cited are impressive, especially if you are a power user with a phone and tablet and are on the go.

The BT connection is simply horrible.  The range is bad enough that if I put my iPhone in my pocket the signal starts to cut out.  Oddly enough, it's even worse if I'm not sitting still.  I take a lot of public transportation (commuter train from home to work with a bus connection) and when I'm walking from one leg of my trip to the next, the signal skips really badly.  I have no clue why motion would interfere with the BT signal, but it does.  I don't keep my phone in my pocket, because that causes signal problems.  So walking along the signal skips with almost every stride (every time my foot hits the ground).  At first I thought maybe this was from swinging my arm while I walk (which definitely made it worse), so now I walk with my phone in the same hand that I hang from my shoulder bag strap and that cuts down about 75% of the signal skips.That is ridiculous.And that's just walking down the street.

These aren't comfortable for me.  The charger and BT radio are in the earbud themselves, which makes the body of the driver pretty massive.  To fix this they give you some rubber barb thingies that are supposed to hook the earbuds into the folds of your ear.  I really don't want that.  I tried to make them work, but I couldn't find a combination of earbud size and barb size that would fit into my ear.  I have pretty big ears, but that's a lot of rubber to try to wad into my ear hole.  And then what happens to all that bulk when you take them off and drop them into your bag or pocket?  Nothing good happens, that's what.The sound quality of these drivers is good, but who cares about fidelity when the signal keeps breaking up and skipping?For this price (currently about $130) I would expect something utterly spectacular.

However, if you primarily use these kinds of headphones for exercising, and the highest level of audio quality is not of a paramount importance to you, then I would suggest the following strategy: buy a pair of inexpensive off-brand headphones (many pretty decent ones can be bought for $20 or even much less), use them for as long as they last (some of the ones I've tested can last you up to a year or longer), and then replace them with a new pair once they break down.

These small packs are what many have dubbed \"lipstick\" packs, primarily due to their size.  They can easily be thrown in a purse, briefcase, or desk drawer for whenever a charge is needed.The size of the Electron is slightly larger, but the capacity is really decent.  For example, an iPhone 5 has a battery capacity of 1440mAh while the iPad Air has one of 8820mAh.  You could fully charge your iPhone a couple of times and give the iPad a really decent boost.  Keep in mind what you want to be using the Electron for and take not of the battery capacity of the device or devices you may wish to charge.I've been playing with this one for a while and am quite satisfied with the performance.  I often like to boost my iPads because I work with them continually and even as small as the Electron is I was able to keep my iPad Air going without depleting it during the day.  I've got a scarcity of receptacles in this old house and the Electron Mini came in handy several times.One interesting feature is that the Electron can identify which type of device you are using, thus eliminating the need for dual ports (2.1A and 1A).  It makes it into a plug-and-play (in this case charge) battery pack.  Simplicity does help a lot of people.  No second guessing which port to use, thereby enabling a faster more efficient charge.The flashlight, or rather the small directed beam of light, won't light up a room, but will enable you to find a lock or help you make your way across that room.  It's not intended to be a torch, but I do find the addition quite handy.  With the quick tap of the power button on the side of the Electron, a digital display comes on.I'm fine with LED display bars, but many of my friends like to see exactly how much charge they have left to work with.  This is a real plus for many people.  The Maxboost Electron Mini has performed quite well over the month or so I've had it and I'm quite pleased with it.

I was surprised by the size, which is smaller than the earlier generations of batteries. This one also had a nice display that not only showed the percent of charge, but also if it was being charged or charging another device. To me that is a big plus over batteries that have no display or use four small LEDs to indicate the approximate percent of charge remaining. This one is exact to one percent.What impressed me is the capacity. Last year a battery rated at 5600mAh was like a brick compared to this one. Before I go on, let me explain rated capacity. There are a number of factors that make it misleading in much the same manner that US EPA ratings for MPG are pie-in-the-sky. Factors such as heat, wear on the battery from repeated charging and even loss from poor quality cables and connectors reduce the rating. Out of the box I multiply the rated capacity by .9, and in the case of this one you can realistically expect about 5040mAh. As time goes on the wear on this battery will reduce the figure to about 3920, but that is probably twelve to eighteen months of hard use.Assuming that this is realistically rated at 5040mAh here is what you can expect from a few common devices:  For an iPhone 5S with an internal battery rated at 1560mAh you can expect to more than triple your use time. For my Samsung Tab 3 10.1, which comes with a stock 6800mAh battery I can still get well over an additional seventy percent more use time. You can do the math on your own device and see how well this will or will not fit your needs.Another feature that impressed me is the charging port will detect the rate your device can be charged and adjust the output accordingly. The range is between 1.0 and 2.1 Amps.A convenience is the built-in flashlight. It's actually handy because of the compact size of this battery. But that it icing on the cake.

Instead of having a series of lights to tell you how much charge is left, they have a LCD display that gives you the percentage of charge left in the battery. No more guessing! When it reads less than 40%, I know I should charge it if I plan on taking it anywhere and expect to get one more full charge from it.The display also tells you what the output is, either 2.1 A or 1 A, depending on the device connected, and it tells you if the power is being output (charging a phone) or input (battery is being charged)Also included is a flashlight.

Honestly I have reviewed so many chargers that I have become somewhat jaded, but this one stands out for a few reasons.First, two of the three ports are among the fastest charging ones I have ever tested, and that is saying a lot because I put this to the test. I charged an iPad (second generation), Samsung Tab 3 10.1 and a Galaxy Note 3 simultaneously. The iPad and Tab 3 were plugged into the 2.1 and 2.0 Amp ports respectively, and the Note 3 into the 1.0 Amp port. Although the Notre 3 chugged along fairly slowly, the two tablets charged quickly. Of course the Note 3 was plugged into the slowest port on this charger, so the fact that it was slow is not a detriment. In fact, that was the expected result.Second, this charger has an array of protective features that lesser ones lack. It detects and protects against over heating and over voltage, and will also prevent overcharging. In addition there is short circuit protection. Considering the total cost to replace the devices I tested, this feature alone is worth the premium price of this charger.Although this is capable of safely providing a full 5.1 Amps simultaneously, be aware that if you have an older vehicle that cannot provide that level of current this charger cannot perform miracles.

It's attachable to a key chain, and no trouble at all to carry around with you...not even as big as a half a pack of Tic Tacs, this little device contains a cable that with male connections for a regular USB to a micro USB, this small device is there for you as a regular connector or an emergency one.I have only one real bone to pick concerning these devices: they are a little difficult to take apart and reassemble. The secret is to first lift UP the end above the word \"Zeetron,\" and once it is free to take apart the other end...either way, when you pull one end, the cable slides along with it, giving that end extra to work with. (To close, reverse the process.)The fact that the connector is quite small and the two devices will by necessity need to be quite close to one another (scarcely more than 3 inches) is not really a huge drawback. By its very nature this really should be considered more of an emergency cable, after all, and this \"drawback\" should be quite apparent by its size.Still and all, give Zeetron credit for coming up with a clever solution to a nagging problem.NOTE: I was provided a review sample of this product on the sole condition that I provide a fair review, which this is.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A compact micro connector that fits on a keychain", "unixReviewTime": 1399680000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2014"}

While I still don't think this is a truly compelling, must-have item, I'll change my rating from 3 to 4 stars since the product does what it should, and could be handy for people who don't remember to bring along a charging cable. The build quality keeps it at a 4 star, rather than 5 star rating.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The product name and description is a bit misleading - this is just a USB cable (either a USB-to-micro USB or USB-to-Lightning version) that folds up into a plastic holder that you can hang on a keychain.I have the micro USB version.The build quality is OK. To unfold it, it's best to unlatch the micro USB end first, then the USB end. Do the opposite when refolding it into the case. Otherwise it can be a struggle to get the ends out of the holder.It works fine - no difference than using any other cable. It is very short - the total length of the cable is about 4 inches.The advantage is that since it is so compact and comes in a plastic holder, you can easily keep this with you with your keys (or hang it onto your backpack, etc.). But, since many powerbanks come with attached cords these days, I can't recall not having access to a cable when I needed it when not at home. At home I have dozens of cables so having one on my keychain is not much of an advantage.Given the price this is an average value. It would be a more compelling purchase if it did more than just serve as a cable, or if the build quality was more robust.[Sample provided for review]", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A compact cable to hang on a keychain", "unixReviewTime": 1399334400, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2014"}

So, if you think you could use a handy, very short, cable for emergency use--and are afraid it might get tangled or damaged floating around in your bag or pocket, this is for you.This is NOT a key chain: It goes ON YOUR key chain. So, a bit inconvenient that you have to set up the key ring yourself, but no big problem, you can either slide a ring onto it, or add this little mini case to your current key chain. The fourth picture shows this USB cable/storage case with a ring, but that is deceiving. It DOES NOT come with a ring.This is NOT a battery charger either. The second picture makes this USB cable/storage case look like it is charging a phone, doesn't it? But it definitely does NOT contain a battery. I'm more than a bit confused as to why they included a picture like this. The wording on the back of the packaging claims that this is a &#34;battery charger&#34;, but it is not. It is small enough that I wouldn't expect this case to contain a battery, but I've seen some very small chargers that hold enough power for an emergency phone call, so this wording may confuse some people. In fact I have a tiny charger the size of a business card and it fits in my wallet, so there are tiny chargers, but this is not that.I questioned a rep from Zeetron about this, and he said they would not be able to change the wording on the packaging until the next run. (The claim, that it is a charger, is mentioned twice on the back of the package.....) (At least they removed it from the product page.....)As it comes from the easy-to-open package, this is a handy little case that protects a short (3 3/16&#34;), flat USB cable and its plugs. The cable moves freely back and forth through the case when the plug-ins are not tucked into the case,which makes it a little easier to maneuver. But the cable cannot be removed from the case . When the plugs are tucked into the case, the cable is taut against the outside of the case. With everything tucked in, the case is 2 7/8&#34; x 1 3/16&#34;. On my unit, the plug-ins are nice and sturdy and seem quality-made.I knocked it down a star, because I think if Zeetron wants to call this a &#34;key chain&#34; they really should have included some kind of a key chain ring--even one of those simple ones where the metal coils around to form a double circle, or maybe a lanyard, or a screw-open ring. And they should get rid of the two misleading pictures on this product page. Oftentimes, people buying on Amazon are in a hurry and hit the gimme' button with just a cursory look at the product page. Personally, I think vendors should be exact and explicit on their product pages. I reserve my five-star ratings for vendors with a thoughtful and determined commitment to providing the best and for those who have a deep-seated and active conscience--from the get-go.*I received a sample product from Zeetron.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A handy cable n' case for emergency use", "unixReviewTime": 1399248000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2014"}

It usually happens shortly after checking into your hotel, exhausted from traveling; early enough to order a pizza, but late enough that most stores are closed. The panic sets in; your eyes glaze over. How did this happen? No more texts to your BFF Jill? OMG!What Do I Do?This is where the Zeetron Ultra Compact Emergency Keychain USB Cable. A gloriously simple idea, this compact device acts as a facilitator (read: it's a short charging cable that is wrapped around a chassis) between your phone (or other micro-USB powered/charged device) and a USB port. As the product picture indicates, simply pull the two ends out of the homes that houses each metal tip and push the appropriate end into the appropriate device (i.e. - micro USB-to-phone and USB-to-USB port). Vo&igrave;la! Your device should be happily regaining power.Now, with all of this being said, there are a few flaws that prevent the Zeetron from being the perfect backup for everyone. They are:&#8226; The length of the cord is very short, measuring in at 3 inches from the near edge of each charging tip. So, no making a garrote, much less a phone call either. Fortunately, the housing does slide along the cord, so you can give yourself more &#34;wiggle room&#34; if you need a bit more space to work.&#8226; Also listed in the product description is the fact that the ZEK USB (for short) is very lightweight and is compact enough to be worn on your keychain with very little interference. The product IS light; by my measurements it comes in at 0.28 ounces. When closed up in its oval shape it is smaller than the average electronic key fob for a car; the downside is that you will have to thread your own hook/jump-ring through the gap to get it to hang from your key ring. This is not an easy task.&#8226; There is not much &#34;give&#34; in terms of pulling out the charging tips or in putting them away. I suggest 1) when taking them out for use, start with the smaller side first. When putting them away, start with the larger end. This gives you a little bit extra room to pull/maneuver the charging tips into position for insertion/removal.&#8226; In re: inserting the micro-USB tip: until the cord has a bit of flexibility, I ended up rubbing the corner against the side edge of the body when putting everything back together for storage. Over time this becomes less of an issue, but you initially do need to take care so that you do not damage/snap off a piece of the tip.&#8226; Also in re: the micro-USB tip: on the underside of the tip itself, the two prongs that stick out to help &#34;lock&#34; the adapter into place while charging are a bit taller than the prongs on my charging cord. This resulted in a bit of difficulty while inserting the ZEK USB into my Galaxy S5 (needed more pressure). It didn't damage my phone and it still charged it, but I felt uncomfortable using it for that purpose after a week or so because I was afraid of damaging the tip, my phone, or both.So What is the Final Verdict?The idea behind this product is great, and I can see it go far. There are a few growing pains to work out, all of which are easily solvable. As such, I am keeping the rating high, as most of the flaws that I see are easily rectifiable and not necessarily intrinsic to the design itself, rather, something that can be corrected without having to alter too much else. Just knowing that you have a device handy as backup should you ever forget to pack a charger is great, but keep in mind that this backup has a very short cord and can take a big of wiggling about to get it to do what you need to do, not to mention requires a USB power source. So I give it an &#34;A&#34; for a great idea, &#34;A&#34; for utility, a &#34;C&#34; for design, and a &#34;B&#34; for effort. All in all, a great entry point and one that I believe is handy to have around.**Disclaimer: This unit was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

It even has three different settings for playing your music allowing it to gently move with the mood or pulsing in and out.I actually use a meditation based on color and enjoy playing it through this using the setting to focus on a single color (the one I am using in my meditation) while the meditation plays through the speakers.But this goes beyond just being beautiful.

The photos make it look nice, but seeing it light up in person is amazing. The colors are so much nicer looking than I ever thought they would be. These aren't disco ball type lights coming from it. It's not just a black casing with rainbow lights behind it. The rainbow colors sparkle almost like shimmering frost or glitter from inside the speaker. It's gorgeous.I set this speaker up in my office to use with my iPhone. I can plug it in and just have the lights rotating or subtly shimmering, using the speaker as a light. Or I can sync my phone with it and play music through it as a speaker. The rainbow lights have several settings that let me change the color scheme of what colors pulse or play when my music is on. The lights can pulse with each beat of the music. And different volume levels for different parts of a song can make one color glow brighter of pulse faster than another.The speaker's volume can be set really loud if needed. Probably a lot louder than many would even use normally. Today my husband was using this speaker in the living room and had his music up loud on it, and I could hear it playing in the basement where I was doing laundry. It produces a lot of sound for something about the size of a small grapefruit. So If you want something to take outside to play music, this can handle it.On the back of the speaker there is a 3.5mm auxiliary cable. So if you want to use a device that doesn't have Bluetooth, or want to save the battery in your device by not using your Bluetooth, you can plug the cable into your device's earphone jack and the music will play through it the same way it does when it's wirelessly synced.There is even an included remote control with buttons on it for controlling all the light functions and also the volume and power controls. On the back of the speaker there is a little slot that's perfect in size for sliding the remote into when you're not using it, so you always know where it is.It's an awesome speaker that is unlike any other one I've ever owned or seen. The lights and colors are stunning and the sound is clear and loud.

Amazon, btw, requires this disclaimer, in these cases.  Anyway, here is what I found:The speaker paired easily and immediately with my iPhone 5, iPad Air, and iPad version 2.  Once paired it sounded great and looked great.  (Actually, it looked great before pairing and better once I saw the light show... more on that later.)The sound was rich and full.  There was plenty of volume to fill several large rooms.  Unlike some admittedly less expensive speakers, there was no loss of Bluetooth signal as I wandered well over the 33' Bluetooth standard limit.There are no controls on the speaker; you control everything using the included remote.  I like that the remote can be stored in a special slot in the speaker so it is out of way, out of sight, and still be where you can find it.The included remote provides full control over the speaker.  You can change its volume, have it relay Pause/Play/Forward/Reverse commands to your device, and make any needed adjustments to the light show.  (More on that later.)If you like, you can also download a free app, as described in the instructions that come with the speaker, which mirrors the controls provided by the speaker.  The app also provides some additional functionality not related to the speaker such as setting a sleep timer and a wake up time.  I already have those additional capabilities in my phone and to me the value is knowing that if ever do lose the remote the speaker remains just as useful.Now, on to the light show!  And it *is* a show.  There are many options for display.  You can have it cycle though its eight colors or select one of several modes where several colors are displayed at the same time in different patterns and change along with the audio.I agree with you that this is not the least expensive Bluetooth speaker available.

I had a big cooking party with private band booked and planned. The band was double booked, so I decided to see what this little guy could do now that I was left with an iPod.In some ways, I think this is actually WAY more fun and I am talking a party for adults (I started to type \"adult party\" but then figured I was about to start incorrect rumors about my dinner parties and worry the neighbors so...nice catch on my part, huh?  But I digress.) Anyway, if this can make a fun light show and create a mood on top of your music when you entertain and no kids are in attendance, just think of what it could do for a dorm party, a slumber party, etc.I do suggest dimming the lights in your room, or even enjoying it outside while you grill and entertain.There is simply something magical about lighting effects making you want to dance, making you feel \"up\" and happy and creating that mood.  This does it for you--way cheaper than hiring some lighting effect dude to go with a band.This one is a keeper for me---because the SOUND is FANTASTIC for the price, and it's clear enough to use outside it's so good.  And on top of that you get the light show and effects.As far as effects, they can be done how you want with the remote--a rainbow, randomly, set to play to the tempo of the song, or more.Even better, it has an Android or IOS app that allows you to use it programmed with this to wake you up with a gentle sunrise and whispers.  Seriously.  There is nothing more glaring than a radio or beeping alarm clock going off to wake you up.  But a gentle sunrise that nudges you asleep with soft whispers?  It is FANTASTIC.I expected this to possibly look hokey when not lit, but cool when lit.  It's far from the truth. It actually looks like a real crystal rather than plastic. Very nice and super shiny and cut in a cool manner with a color that is not clear like plastic but slightly amber or brown so it looks like something far more natural--meaning it looks pretty wherever you put it, at all times, unlike most speakers.The remote fits right in the back of the speaker.I can't stop playing with it!Speaker provided by YantouchReview is my unbiased opinion", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The band cancelled but the speaker kept the party going", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2014"}

It offers excellent sound quality and solid build quality. On the flip side, the user interface has a couple of (for me) major downsides. Depending on how you feel about the light display, this can be either be a unique speaker or something that&#8217;s a poor value.Full review: This takes the typical mini bluetooth speaker a step further by building in a light display that can be tied to the music being played.My initial impression was very favorable &#8211; it feels solid and well-built. It&#8217;s all plastic, but the plastic is of good quality. It is also very well packaged, which is a departure from the usual &#8220;just toss it in a box&#8221; approach that&#8217;s typically seen. Unfortunately, the brief user guide that comes with it is very sparse and doesn&#8217;t really go through the product features or explain them very well. A better guild should have been included given the price point. Also included in the box is a cable (more on that later) and AC plug adapter for recharging, and a very nice cloth carry bag.The sound quality is excellent. The upper and mid-ranges are clear; there&#8217;s ample bass that doesn&#8217;t sound muddy or boomy; and unlike other bluetooth speakers the volume range is excellent &#8211; you can really blare this puppy! Zero complaints about the sound quality be it in bluetooth mode or direct wired mode.The built-in battery is 1300mAh which gives it a longer run time than pretty much any other speaker I&#8217;ve used. Excellent!The user interface is tied to the remote. I don&#8217;t like that since I&#8217;m prone to losing remotes. Granted, this has a slot for storing the remote but should you lose it you&#8217;ve also lost pretty much all functionality from the speaker since there are zero controls on the speaker itself. For me, that&#8217;s a major negative.The remote is small and thin, with well-marked buttons that provide a good amount of tactile feedback. No complaints about the remote &#8211; I just find it problematic that it is a mandatory item to use for speaker control.In addition to the remote you can download an app for iOS or Android for control options. I found the app unwieldy to use versus the remote, but it&#8217;s an option, and also serves as a &#8220;backup&#8221; should you lose the remote.As is usually the case with recent bluetooth speakers, zero problems pairing this with a device. The operating range is also very good with zero dropouts at 20+ feet.You can also direct-connect the speaker to a device, but instead of using a standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord, you have to use a cord (which is supplied) that has a 3.5mm plug on one end, and a mini USB plug on the other. That&#8217;s not a problem except for the fact that you have to remember to bring that cable along &#8211; a traditional 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord (of which I have a bunch of) won&#8217;t work.The advantage to the unique cable is that it can also be used as a charging cable (the included cable has 2 ends: one is a standard USB plug; the other is the 3.5mm plug). So, while it is unique, it means you only need to carry one cord to both charge and direct-connect.The light show is what really sets this apart from other speakers. That&#8217;s hard to judge in terms of value. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care much for it. Yes, it was fun for a short time, but I use speakers for the benefit of my ears, not my eyes. After a few minutes of playing with it, I turned it off (in addition to a variety of lighting options, it can also be turned off completely).So, if you find the lights distracting or unwelcome, you can turn them off but you&#8217;re paying a lot more for a speaker than you should &#8211; there are a number of bluetooth speakers that sound as good as this at far lower price points since they don&#8217;t include the light show.My ratings:Build quality = 5Sound quality = 5Instructions = 2User interface = 2Direct connect approach = 3Overall value = 5 (if you&#8217;re into a light show); 2 (if you just like to listen to speakers)Overall rating = 4.

The speaker was securely packed with plastic inserts to protect it. Inside the box was the Speaker, a multi-function remote, an instruction manual, a combo USB cable charging cable and stereo cable, a wall plug and a carrying pouch. This is a fairly compact Bluetooth speaker with a clear dome on the front over the lighting elements.  The back has a bass tube and a storage slot for the remote and the sides have a speaker port on each side. It looks really cool. It has no buttons and only a mini USB port for charging, so you must use the remote to operate this speaker and the included combo stereo cable if you want to attached this speaker directly to your music source instead of via Bluetooth. It looks like it is designed and built well.&#9830; Installation - I plugged in the included Mini USB charging cable into the unit and into a USB wall charger to give it an initial charge before testing it out.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the speaker was charged, a did a variety of tests to try it out using my iPhone 5S.Test #1 (Sound Quality Test) - I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to Michael Bubl&eacute; to Excision Bass Heavy Dubstep (the Destroid album), and it sounded absolutely amazing.  The entire range of sound was great with crisp highs and decent bass response for a small speaker.  It handled all of the different types of music that I tried and sounded great with each of them.  It is probably the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I have ever tested.Test #2 (Sound Performance Test) - After I got past the basic sound quality, I tried out a few more technical tests. I put speaker directly in front of me and started playing a Dolby HD Surround Sound test video. It sounded great, and had some stereo effects due to the separate speaker ports on each side of the speaker.  Not perfect, but you did hear some stereo separation in the playback. I also played a frequency test file that started at 20Hz and found that the speakers started producing sound around the 65Hz range. The sound continued with sound being audible all the way up to 15000Hz. Decent range for a small speaker.Test #3 (Use Test) - I tested the Bluetooth range by walking through my house and got a good distance away, about 15-20 feet around a few walls, before the sound dropped out. Walking back started the sound back up immediately. Once the sound testing was done via Bluetooth streaming, I tried out the sound from the Aux input cable from my iPhone and it sounded just as good.  Next I tried out the lighting effects.  Now this is where this speaker really stood out.  The speaker came with a pretty detailed remote with 18 different buttons.  The remote was very responsive and had buttons for the usual playback and volume functions as well as several different lighting functions.  The colors of the speaker were amazing with lights that could change into just about any color in the spectrum.  The colors were extremely vivid and looked great.  It had some cool functions for different lighting effects.  My favorite was the tempo based lights that would flash with the beat of the music.  It looked great and was really fun.  When I was testing the speaker, my daughters (ages 4 and 7) came running to see it.  They each took turns playing with the remote and kept pestering me to let them play with it more.  After I was done with my testing, I connected it to my daughter's iPad Mini and the two girls disappeared with the speaker for about two hours.  They closed all the doors and windows in their room and the hallway to make it dark and had a dance party.  It was easy to use for them and they loved it.Conclusion:Overall, this speaker sounds amazing.  On top of that, the lighting effects are really great with extremely vivid colors and cool lighting modes. While this is an expensive speaker, it is pretty impressive in my initial testing.  If you are looking for a great sounding Bluetooth speaker with cool lighting functions, this one is an excellent choice.

I certainly concur with most of her points, but some of my experiences and observations are different.The sound quality is almost at the same level as an in-ear monitor, which is truly impressive.While you can only control this speaker from an external source (either the included remote or an iPhone or Android smartphone app), you are not fumbling with multifunction buttons that are both small and in some cases confusing. For me this feature is right up there with sound quality. If you lose the remote (or it gets destroyed by a pet), you can still control the speaker via your phone. Of course at this time there are only apps for IOS and Android, so if you are using a Windows-based phone you are going to be out of luck. As for finding the app, it's ironic that it is not available in Amazon's app store at the time of this review, but I found it by searching the Google Play Store using yantouch as the keyword. The app name is BedTimeSocial. More about that below.One feature that I immediately loved is how easy it is to connect this via bluetooth. No weird button sequences to navigate: press the bluetooth button on the remote, scan for new devices with your phone, tablet or PC, pair and connect.When I received my review sample I was a little perplexed by the unit. The split cable with a micro USB and a 3.5mm connector threw me, but I discovered that one was for powering the speaker and the other was to plug in a hardwired sound source, like a non-bluetooth MP3 player or sound out from your PC. Here is the catch: you cannot power your speaker from the same source that provides the sound signal. In other words, you cannot connect both ends to a PC - out for sound and the other for power. The signal quality doing that is terrible (I had to try.) But that is clearly cited in the instructions, so it's a non issue for me. This speaker works with any USB cable with a micro USB end and a separate 3.5mm cable, so the split cable that ships with it is a convenience, not a requirement. You can also use any USB wall charger that is rated at 1.0 Amps (it will not work with anything below that, which includes a lot of PC USB ports.)The remote is a major convenience. There is even a slot for it in the speaker itself. Since downloading the Android app, though, I prefer using my phone to control it since that is where I am streaming music from anyway. I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Android 4.3 and the app provides me with all of the features on the remote as well as using the speaker as an alarm clock.Overall I am totally pleased with this speaker based on the sound quality alone. When I factor in the convenience of being able to control it from my phone I feel it raises the bar for all higher end bluetooth speakers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than anticipated", "unixReviewTime": 1398556800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2014"}

This comes with a remote control that gives you several choices for how you want the lights to display. You can set it to cycle through the different colors, use a single color, or my favorite: pulsate all different colors to the beats of the music. I love sitting and watching it. The lights are just as much fun to watch when it's playing classical music as it with rock or rap. Using it to listen to meditation music gives the experience a whole new dimension.This speaker comes with a 3 way USB charging cable that has a 3.5mm Aux plug and a USB plug on one end and the other end is a MiniUSB plug. So you can charge it while plugging in an MP3 player at the same time. I usually leave it plugged in when I'm playing it in the house. Of course I normally connect using the wireless Bluetooth. It pairs almost instantly to my iPhone or my iPad or Kindle Fire HD. There's a storage slot in the unit for the little remote which is nice because there aren't any controls on the unit itself so I don't want to lose it. It also comes with a carrying pouch but I like leaving it out on a shelf because it has such a cool look.It has an Android app that can be downloaded that will mimic a sunrise with different colors, gradually going to a bright white. It even has bird sounds and whisperings in the background to make for a pleasant gradual wake up experience. I like that the lightshow can be enjoyed even without music, or it can be set to a single color light. The speaker has a vey nice look, even when turned off. On one hand it looks futuristic and the other sort of retro with all the pulsing colors. It certainly gets a lot of attention when we entertain. I love watching it while listening to music.

It seemed to charge in the &#34;normal&#34; amount of time. I was unable to sync my iPhone using this cable- the rear panel of the package says it will &#34;charge&#34;, so that may be expected behavior.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The plastic of this in 3/8&#34; thick, which means that it is a big of a struggle to get on and off a keychain. The cord is so short that using it while attached to my car keys was problematic. The struggle to get this on and off a keychain ruined some of the convenience, although that could be solved with some sort of easy-separate keychain- something like people use for a valet key.* When putting the cord back into the case, you have to remember to put the USB connector in first, otherwise it won't go together. it resulted in a few choice words until I remembered the secret.=== Summary ===* While it may not be the 100% most convenient design, if you need one of these cables in a pinch, this isn't a bad thing to have on hand. Rather than my keychain, I ended up putting it on a loop of string inside my computer bag, attaching it to one of the many metal loops.

This is a short microUSB / Apple Lightning cable stuffed inside the head of a hippopotamus. Go figure, a hippopotamus.Cute design aside, this is a good solid cable. The flat cable is made with really thick insulation. The cable ends are big and rubbery, so they will take a lot of abuse. The input side of the cable (the rectangular USB plug) looks big but in fact is just about the standard size for a cable end. You shouldn't have space issues with the connector. The business end is another story - they insulation is also big and rubbery. There are two connectors on that one end and they are in a Y formation. If you have a thick case, this connector might not work. If the connectors were 90 or 180 degrees apart, case thickness might not be a problem.OK, on to the fun part of this cable. When you take it out of the package, the hippo head is pulled down over the connector ends, and a key ring is visible. You slide the hippo head toward the key ring. Once the ends are visible, simply grab them and pull them apart. The hippo head will slide up over the key ring and allow you to use the cable straightened out.

Most of my Lightning cables are cheap third-party knock offs.  I've gotten used to this annoying message; it's fine with me as long as the cable actually charges my phone.

It takes a bit of force to get the connector into my phone and my iPad, but disconnecting it is even harder. I have to pull quite hard, and I'm genuinely concerned that the force that I have to use could cause the connector to break off in my device.When I look closely at the tip of the lightning connector, I can see some very small scratches and one gouge.

My Apple cable, which I've had for more than six months and use on a daily basis, doesn't have a single visible scratch.This is a shame, because this cable could have been uniquely useful.

It's a great idea, but I'm not totally sold on the execution as I will explain.What you get here is a short USB to both lightning and micro-USB cable (both on one end) that is looped through a keychain.  A hollow flexible hippo-head slides down the cable to cover up the cable ends.  By pushing the cable through, you can easily plug it into a USB port or a charger and charge up your Apple product with lightning cable input (iPhone, iPad, etc) or a device with a Micro-USB input.  For those of us who have a bluetooth headset with Micro-USB, it is nice to have both on 1 cable.  The cable itself seems high quality and sturdy with enough flex to make it easy to reach between devices.The problem I had is that the lightning cable is not extended off of the plastic block at all - it is flush with the block.  That means if you have any sort of case on your phone at all, even a thin one, the cable won't work (my phone is in an Amazon Basics case).  Zeetron addressed this already with theirZeetron Ultra Compact Emergency Keychain Usb Cable - Black Lighting to USB (For Iphone 5, 5c, 5s, Ipad 4, Air, Mini, Ipod Touch 5th Gen)by having the lightning cable on a small extension block.  This extension was good enough to get past the thin case on my iPhone.

For the rest of us, it seems to work well but the short length of the doubled-over cable limits practical use.Tested with my son's HTC Droid DNA by charging the DNA via laptop and power bank connections. The USB and micro USB connectors fit perfectly into every port, and charging occurred as expected. No issue at all with performance, only with design.The unit's charging cable is fed through the hippo's mouth and through the top of its head, then through a key ring, and then back down through the hippo. This effectively cuts the usable length of the cord in half... but then the hippo's head sits over half of the remaining space, really only leaving about one inch of cable to play with.That was workable, though still a confined fit, when charging from a laptop port as we could lay the phone on top of the laptop (see picture). It was also workable when charging from a power bank, as the phone and bank can be laid down next to each other too.  However, it was not workable from our USB enabled outlet or from plug-in USB power adapters as they all are at wall outlet height (typically 10 to 16 inches off of the floor or counter)... and the cable just can't reach.If you would like to see pictures of the hippo unit we received, please navigate to its main sales page and then scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section, and our pictures are there. It is a nice looking unit that feels good in the hand.The Amazon sales listing notes that this item includes a one year warranty, so if an issue arises within that time period I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this cable gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for a cute novelty for the tech savvy secondary school kid in your life, a USB charging cable of this size, style and design for use similar to what I have described above, then feel free to give this one a try.

Sure, I keep a charger in my car; carrying a charging cable is inconvenient and could get damaged in a bag or pocket. Zeetron has thought long and hard about a way to address this matter and come up with a solution to make it more convenient to bring one along with you:A keychain hippo.More specifically, a silicone keychain hippo that \"regurgitates\" two ends of a single cable; one end has a USB connector, the other has an \"A\"-shaped splitter with a micro-USB tip on one end and a lightning connector on the other. The keyring prevents the cord from being pulled completely out of the mouth; conversely, the connectors prevent the cable from being pulled out of the opening on top of the \"head\" of the hippo.When you are finished using the cable, simply pull up on the keyring and the hippo will \"eat\" the connectors, hiding them completely within the \"head\" of the unit. The excess cable will sprout from the top of the head of the hippo, resulting in the head hanging from the cord and becoming a \"keychain\" once again.While using this product is very simple, there are a few issues:* Since the cable is folded in half over the keyring, you do not have a lot of room to maneuver between plugging the USB adapter into a power source and then the appropriate charging tip into your device. As a result, you are limited to using this as a charger with USB ports that are near flat surfaces. Otherwise, your phone/device will be dangling precariously from the charging tip, as well as pulling against the USB plug and the port that your \"hippo\" is plugged into.* Unless you also choose to carry a USB/AC Outlet adapter as well, this keychain forces you to seek out USB charging sources. You will either need to carry an adapter, purchase a separate external battery/portable charger, or be aware of what options are available to you at your destination.* Even though there are two adapter tips available (micro-USB and a lightning connector), you are not going to be able to use both at the same time. There simply is not enough room between them on the A-frame.Unfortunately, most of the issues above are pretty important. That being said, if you purchase the Zeetron Hippo Charger as an emergency backup cable, then this is a good choice. It is handy if you forgot to charge your phone, lost your cable, or otherwise find yourself in a position where you have access to a power source (bit of a non-sequitur, but I really do strongly recommend purchasing a portable battery) but don't have your usual charging cable handy, then you can whip out your keys and go \"I have my Hippo!\".So, in conclusion, if you are considering the Zeetron Hippo as a primary charger, you will be disappointed. There are simply too many design flaws to consider this product as your first choice for charging your device(s). However, if you are buying this as a [cute] keychain fob to have on-hand for one of those times when you need a cable and are nowhere near home, then this is an excellent product!Oh, and did I mention that it is pretty cute, too? This would make a wonderful gift for that techie person in your life that has lots of little gadgets and would enjoy something different for his/her keychain!**Disclaimer: This hippo was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

I personally am not going to switch my keys over to this (I'm not a hippo-kinda guy), but I can see this being a great option for kids who might need a charging cable.The feature that makes this outstanding to me is that it has both a Lightning and micro-USB connector built into the plug. So in my case, one cable would serve both my iPhone 5S and my Kindle. The two ends of the USB cable are covered by the hippo head, and sliding the head down the cable exposes the two plugs. The rubber is pretty flexible, so it's not that difficult to work the plugs through the &#34;mouth&#34; of the hippo for use.The main down side is the length of the cable. The cable is about four inches, so there's two inches on each side once it's linked through the keyring. With the hippo head pushed up to the keyring, the effective overall length of the cable is about two inches, so you're going to have to be right next to the computer or power outlet to use it. Still, it's better than being completely without a cable when you desperately need to connect to a computer to synch up or recharge.For the price and looks, the Hippo cable is a pretty good deal (so long as you know the limitations).Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A cute \"just in case\" cable with a nice 2-in-1 plug option...", "unixReviewTime": 1402272000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2014"}

Like others, this can also be used with a mini-plug (provided along with USB-to-mini charger cable, both very short wires). So, it delivers a respectable sound, not audiophile, but as it's bigger than the collapsible pocket-sized versions, better than those for a sound audible across a room. It lacks a bass control or much of a setting; the cube buttons are on/off, phone, volume up/down, and Bluetooth. Two plugs at the back, and an indicator light, red for charging and green when charged. Booklet instructions are clearly written and easy to read.An advantage is the cube design. A speaker is front facing, opposite the plugs; the sides are solid. It's a fun piece to look at and hold. A grip is glued on the bottom of this handy unit, and it's weighty enough not to easily tip over or be dragged on a surface, too.One limit is the fact when the audio plug is in that the unit cannot be altered by volume. Only the master unit device controls this. Also, when charging (it says about 4-6 hours a charge and it takes about 1.5 hours from the start to charge itself), the unit cannot be used, somewhat of an obstacle if you want to use it while charging it--sorry.

All three had something going for them that the others didn't. For this it was sound quality.This has the perfect combination of volume and frequency response. I am especially impressed with the low end response. I almost exclusively listen to jazz, but the bass on this speaker was so deep that I tested it withLed Zeppelin, and especially John Paul Jones' bass on Dazed and Confused. That sold me. Not that I regularly pull out my rock albums, but I knew that the speakers were great. Of course my normal test album, Miles Davis'Kind Of Blue, was superbly reproduced with a nicely balanced highs, mids and lows.Operation is simple. After you switch it on, press the button with the bluetooth logo, scan from your device, pair and connect. I would have preferred the more modern way where you turn the speaker on, scan and connect, but having a dedicated bluetooth button is just as good in my opinion. Anything is better than the old style multi-function button method.One thing that I love about this speaker is it has front and rear speakers, which I am guessing accounts for the rich sound. When I was testing mine it sounded like there was a cross-over circuit because of the bass separation on some tracks, but I cannot be absolutely positive because the speakers are pretty close together.Of course the price is a great feature too.

They have the same kinds of features: wireless (bluetooth) connectability, volume control and the ability to interrupt the music and take a call. They get loud enough to fill a room, and pack all that sound in a surprisingly small package. What makes the difference is the style and shape, and sometimes the style and shape effects the overall sound quality.I really like the form factor of this one. It&#8217;s a tessellated cube, covered with squares, and on two sides of the cube there are little holes in the squares that help transmit the music in two directions for a kind of stereo effect.It seems to be pretty durable.

I AM looking for audio I can listen to, potentially for extended periods, while sitting outside or while traveling to watch a movie without headphones. The Magic Cube provides the capability, but only just barely.The sound is a bit tinny, it lacks low end oomph (I'm not looking for wall shaking bass, but I want it to sound good, well formed - the Cube is messy on the low end).

If given the option of this speaker or using headphones, I will opt for headphones without question.For the current price range, there are much better options. I like the Arctic S111, but that's a dual speaker option (though it weighs not a ton more than the Magic Cube).The reason I am giving the speaker 3 stars is because it is usable. It does what you expect. It just doesn't do it in any extraordinary fashion. Nor does it make you want to listen to music just to hear the music.

It does.  If I bring it close my ear I can hear it buzzing. It buzzes only when it is NOT charging anything.----------- Original review -------We own a number of mobile devices from different manufactures, we have Android devices, Apple devices, Samsung devices. I have tested a larger number of wall chargers and it is common to see that different devices perform better on some ports than than others, this is particularly true for Apple devices.  Google starting with Jelly Bean 4.21 figured out the Apple protocol and now able to draw the optimal charge on ports designed for Apple.Now comes Bolse SmartIC Technology and it is able to negotiate the right charging protocol for each device it is talking to, so it can provide the optimal current for every device on every port.I tested Bolse charger charger with a current monitor and three different devices Nexus Phone, iPad Mini, and Samsung Galaxy Tablet. It provided each device the optimal maximum current and thus charged them very quickly.  It gave me one of the best performances of all my wall chargers.  Detailed current monitor readings are included below for those who are interested.Bolse 4 port charger comes with a 58 inch cord and a regular sized plug. I was able to replace two dual chargers that took up three slots on my power strip with one regular size plug which is connected to this 4 port USB charger. I am always running out of slots on my power strips so this charging station a big space saver for me.The charger's size is 3.25\"L x 2.125\"W x 1.75\"H. Its weight is 5.1 oz (not counting the cord).  The slot are positioned on the top, which I find very convinient.  I have this charger positioned on the \"charging area\" by the front door - this is where all the devices that I use every day are charged.&#10152; Test Results:======================The performance on all ports was consistant and optimal for each device I have charged.

I'll start with those: the biggest plus to this one is each port has its own circuit.If you've carefully shopped you know that every other charging hub on the market has ports designated for Apple and Android. Most of the time they are interchangeable. On this hub each port will adapt to what you plug into it. That is the most important distinction.Each connector has a sensing circuit that will detect the charging rate of your devices, then prevent them from over charging. If one port were to burn out the remaining ones will continue to work (not that I am expecting any port to burn out on mine, but I do live in a lightning prone area.)This hub also has some features that I love. On the top of my list is the cord, which is almost five feet long. That gives me the freedom to place the hub where I want it, instead of having a short cord act as a leash. Also this hub will work on AC current ranging from 100 to 240V, so it's ready for international use out of the box. You will still have to provide a plug adapter though.I tested mine with a variety of devices, including my power hungry Samsung Tab 3 10.1 and it charged it as quickly as the OEM charger that came with it. This test was conducted with all four ports populated with Samsung, HTC and Apple devices and I selected the ports randomly.Bottom line: if you are seeking a quality multi-port charging hub and do not want to concern yourself with mundane decisions like which port does a particular device get plugged into, this is the one.

It's the only desktop charger that I've tried out (among a number of others) that is truly portable. It's relatively small and lightweight, and there is no wall wart or brick; all of the power supply components are inside the unit, and there is just a five-foot cord that runs to a plug that will fit easily in a single power strip or wall outlet position.The compromise for compactness is total power delivery, which is 25 watts, not 35 or 40 as in some other desktop chargers, which of course are bulkier and much less portable; the other compromise is 4 output ports instead of 5 or 6. But if you need something to take on the road that has substantial capability and will still go comfortably in your travel bag, this unit will meet that need.The unit has what it calls &#34;smart&#34; charging, meaning any device can be used with any port. I tried this with iPhone, Android, and others, and this definitely works. Some chargers limit certain devices to certain ports, but you don't have that issue here. The unit also supposedly charges each device at full capability. I found that to be the case, too, and demonstrated it to myself by comparing charging times with other chargers. The limitation, though, is the total power output of the charger. It puts out up to 5 amps, so if you connect four devices that can each charge at 2 amps, you won't get full power charging because that exceeds device capacity.For a lightweight unit it's surprisingly well-built and sturdy, and should stand up well to travel.

In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's large, effective, versatile and well designed. It's one of the largest external battery that I've come across in terms of capacity (with impressive 10,400 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than some of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S, iPhone 3G, Kindle Keyboard, Mobee Magic Bar, Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generation iPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged LifeCHARGE battery. I was also able to charge my iPad to completely, and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around. If there was an easy way of connecting this battery to an ultrabook I would not be surprised if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as well.The battery comes with a micro USB cable that allows you to charge it by either connecting it to a computer or a stand-alone USB charger. I think this would have been a much more effective product if it had two additions that some of its competitors already incorporate into their batteries/power banks: incorporated wall-outlet prongs for easy charging, and a permanently attached retractable micro USB cable. These two additions would make this battery stand out in the already very crowded field of external batteries/chargers.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Capacious, Elegant and Portable External Battery", "unixReviewTime": 1402099200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2014"}

So, if you are heading out and there's a chance that you won't see a wall outlet or car charger for quite a while, or if you are in &#34;charge&#34; of charging the whole family's devices on a trip, this is a charger that will get the job done. No bells, no whistles, except for a flashlight feature and four LEDs to give you charging status. But then, you are not paying for any features that you won't use, either.One feature that a 5-star, simple, convenient charger would have (and this four-star charger does not have) is a built-in USB cable. With this portable charger, you will still have to lug around a cable or two. Too bad: A rubber band does the trick and will keep your cables and charger together, but is so un-cool.This charger has four bright blue LEDs to give you status of the charge. Unlike aluminum-cased battery chargers, you can see the light of the LEDs right through this thin-walled plastic case, so more than the four lights light up: You get a blotchy light effect from inside the case.This unit weighs in at a little more than a half pound. So, think hard if you really need a power bank that provides this much charge. While it is necessary for long trips or lots of devices, if you only need to charge your one phone once in a while, this is overkill. Overkill is definitely a problem when it comes to chargers: A half pound is real weight. Do you need it? Or can you get by with a 2600mAh lipstick-size charger that will fit in your pocket and will charge up your one phone one time.For those of you who do not like in-your-face logos marring the fronts of your possessions: Notice that the Lifecharge logo is very big and bold and black and centered.

I will avoid repeating the physical characteristics and provide my own observations and experiences with the review sample that I received.This battery pack has the capacity to satisfy most power users who are glued to their phone. It will also provide a respectable margin of additional use time for the true geeks who are constantly glued to both a smart phone and a tablet. For that breed of power user even the 10400mAh capacity this provides may not be enough, but for ninety-nine percent of us this is more than ample.Before proceeding I want to disclose that I always multiply new battery packs by .9 to get a more realistic capacity. That's because there are some losses in efficiency from heat, the transfer process, condition of your charging cable and myriad other factors. Using my quick formula you can expect about 9360mAh from this battery.Even at the readjusted capacity you can expect some significant increases in use time. An Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh battery will get an additional six hundred percent of use time attached to this. An iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery will get slightly more than double its normal use time. Of course plugging two devices into this battery will alter the effective use time increases, but some very simple math will let you forecast how much.I tested this with a few devices, including an iPhone 5S, iPad 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Samsung Tab 3 10.1. In all cases I connected two devices simultaneously (Apples first, then the Samsungs) and the charging rate from this battery was slightly less than if I plugged each device individually into their respective OEM wall chargers. That's actually pretty impressive.Note that the instructions claim that you can charge this battery from a PC's USB port. I tried that on my ThinkPad T61 and it was extremely show compared to one of my Samsung wall chargers to which I connected it. This is more of a problem with my ThinkPad than the battery, but I wanted to point that out to set expectations.Bottom line: this battery pack is solid, reliable and has more than enough capacity for all but true power users.

This model eliminates that.When I mentioned that this is relatively capacity I am putting it into the context of the high capacity batteries that seem to have flooded the market this year.

It does come with a cable for charging the unit itself, and the cable can be reversed to charge any device that accepts a micro USB connector.Power users will probably scoff at this battery, but if you are among the 95% of use who need extra capacity only occasionally this is not only more than adequate, but compact enough to fit a purse or pocket. If you need something with more capacity I suggest checking out theLifecharge Juicypack 10400mAh Portable Charger.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A major convenience with no frills", "unixReviewTime": 1402272000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2014"}

The Juicypack 2600 is one of the lipstick types, pretty small and extremely portable but can provide a full charge of emergency battery when you need it.  Just do not forget your phone's cable.You can recharge it in two ways.  Using an AC USB adapter, which is the faster way, or through your PC's USB slot.  To charge your phone, simple plug your phone with its USB cable the the battery pack's USB slot.  No need to press a button as it automatically starts charging once connected.It is interesting that this battery pack has a lanyard hole but no lanyard included.The Lifecharge 2600 comes with a white microUSB cable and a short user's guide.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A full days charge in your pocket", "unixReviewTime": 1402704000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2014"}

Here are my comments.1. This is a basic \"lipstick\" charger that comes with a micro USB cable for charging.2. The back of the box says a full charge time is 6-8 hours, which is pretty long for a unit with such a small output.3. I fully charged this, then used it to charge my iPhone 4S from 70% to 96%, which took an hour. Acceptable, but not impressive.4. My main issue with this charger is that there is no way to know how much of a charge is left. There is no button to press to make the two indicator lights go on. Inf fact the indicator lights didn't go on at all while I was charging my iPhone.So after I charged my iPhone 4S I had no way to know how much of the charge in this unit had been depleted. To me that's a serious design issue. I'm not going to carry a charger that I can't randomly check to see how much of a charge is left.Bottom line: This works, but unless you charge it daily, you can't be sure how much of a charge is available should an emergency arise.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "No way to see how much of a charge is left", "unixReviewTime": 1402790400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2014"}
